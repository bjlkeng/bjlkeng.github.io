<p>Modern probability theory is typically derived from the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms">Kolmogorov axioms</a>,
using measure theory with concepts like events and sample space.
In one way, it's intuitive to understand how this works as Laplace
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_definition_of_probability">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable
to it, to the number of all cases possible, when [the cases are] equally
possible. ... Probability is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the
number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the
cases possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the intuition of this view of probability breaks down when we want to
do more complex reasoning.  After learning probability from the lens of coins,
dice and urns full of red and white balls, I still didn't feel that I had
have a strong grasp about how to apply it to other situations -- especially
ones where it was difficult or too abstract to apply the idea of <em>"a fraction
whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the
number of all the cases possible"</em>.  And then I read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/physics/theoretical-physics-and-mathematical-physics/probability-theory-logic-science">Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</a> by E. T. Jaynes.</p>
<p>Jaynes takes a drastically different approach to probability, not with events and
sample spaces, but rather as an extension of Boolean logic.  Taking this view made
a great deal of sense to me since I spent a lot of time <a class="reference external" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/">studying and reasoning</a> in Boolean logic.  The following post
is my attempt to explain Jaynes' view of probability theory, where he derives
it from "common sense" extensions to Boolean logic.  (<em>Spoiler alert: he ends
up with pretty much the same mathematical system as Kolmogorov's probability
theory.</em>) I'll stay away from any heavy derivations and stick with the
intuition, which is exactly where I think this view of probability theory is most
useful.</p>

<p>Even though it was just a scant few years ago, my research in grad school seems
like it was from another lifetime.  Nowadays I deal with data and most of my
code revolves around manipulating and extracting interesting insights from it.
However in my previous life I spent quite a bit of time dealing with
satisfiability problems.  So before I start writing about data and related
topics, I thought I'd kick it old school and write about some topics from my
formative years.</p>

<p>I have something to admit: I've never done any serious programming in a
functional language.  Yes, yes, I've done some small school assignments in
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a> (a
dialect of Lisp), even helping out my friend from another university with his
Scheme assignment but nothing <em>real</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/functions-and-procedures/#id3" id="id1">1</a>.  Does this
make me a worse programmer?  Probably not, I imagine most developers haven't
done anything <em>real</em> with functional programming.  Although that's probably not
what you'd expect from reading <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>,
where you don't know programming if you haven't tried Clojure or Haskell <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/functions-and-procedures/#id4" id="id2">2</a>.</p>
<p>My position is much more pragmatic: I'm interested in tools and techniques that
help me solve problems faster, cleaner and with less headache.  Ideas and
concepts from functional programming languages are <em>supposed</em> to help with at
least some of that -- and they do; they're just not a panacea for all your
programming woes.  Like most things a solid grasp of the fundamentals goes a
long way.  So the topic of this post is about something pretty fundamental: a
subroutine.  In particular, two important kinds of subroutines:
procedures and pure functions.</p>

<p><strong>Preface</strong>: <em>Second post and I'm already off topic according to my subtitle.  I
do have another post that is more topic appropriate but it's been pretty hectic
so I haven't had time to finish it.  Although, investing is definitely a kind of
technical topic involving data and numbers, so one could argue it is still on
topic.  And argue I shall!  Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>A lot of smart people I meet frequently mention that they have no clue about
investing or other related financial matters.  They're quite right that modern
finance can get complicated really fast such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model">option pricing models</a> (that require
differential equations and other such complicated maths) but as in most things
though, a little common sense goes a long way.  So I want to share an analogy
that I think will help people understand a rational way to invest <em>i.e.</em> value
investing.  In particular, the discussion will be geared towards investing in
publicly traded stocks but the general idea applies to most asset classes.</p>

<p>Hi all, this the first post in my technical blog.  For a long time I've resisted making
a blog about anything technical because, to be frank, I didn't feel like I
was qualified.  What makes me more qualified now?  Nothing really, I'm just a bit less
afraid of <a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/386/">being wrong</a>.</p>
<p>So maybe a good place to start is what I used to setup this blog and what the
domain/title mean.
For my personal blog (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.briankeng.com/">www.briankeng.com</a>), where
I discuss random worldly wisdom that I come across, I use <a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.
For this one, I used something a bit more technical (because why not?):</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Great place to host a static website (free) but also has some of that "hacker
cred".  It's quite easy to use (if you've used git before) and also quite
well <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">documented</a>
on how to get your domain setup.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<br><a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> (static site generator)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The recommended static site generator with Github Pages is Jekyll but one
thing I wanted for this site is to make use of <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebooks</a>.  After a bit of searching, I found
Nikola to be a good match because it supports IPython Notebooks out of the box
(as opposed to Jekyll which required some fiddling), and seemd to have a reasonably
simple setup.  The really interesting line from the <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#getting-more-themes">documentation</a>
is this quote: <code class="docutils literal">DON'T READ THIS MANUAL. IF YOU NEED TO READ IT I FAILED, JUST USE THE THING.</code>
Exactly the sentiment I was going for.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<br><a class="reference external" href="https://themes.getnikola.com/#bootstrap3">Bootstrap3</a> theme and <a class="reference external" href="bhttp://bootswatch.com/readable/">Readable</a> Bootstrap theme.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Bootstrap3 is the default theme for Nikola, conveniently using <a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>,
the most popular HTML/CSS/JS framework for the web.  Since I'm not a very
good designer using high quality themes/framework is definitely ideal.</p>
<p>The default Nikola theme, however, was not too my liking.  A bit too spartan for me.  Fortunately, Nikola has a really cool
feature where you can take an existing Bootstrap theme from <a class="reference external" href="http://bootswatch.com">http://bootswatch.com</a>
and skin the default Nikola Bootstrap theme.  I chose the <a class="reference external" href="bhttp://bootswatch.com/readable/">Readable</a> theme because I'm
a huge fan of making things easy-to-read (you should see how large the font
size is on my devices, frequently referred to as "old people font size").</p>
<p>Even with the new Bootstrap theme, the site layout didn't quite look right.
So I fiddled around with the layout and placement of items, pretty much
copying the layout of another blog I really enjoy <a class="reference external" href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/">programming in the twenty-first century</a> by James Hague.
It was interesting playing around with HTML templates and CSS but pretty much
confirmed that it's not really what I like doing.  Getting to a satisfactory
layout was as much effort as I really wanted to put in.</p>
