<p>For a while now, I've really enjoyed diving deep to understand
probability and related fundamentals (see
<a class="reference external" href="posts/probability-the-logic-of-science/">here</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="posts/maximum-entropy-distributions/">here</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="posts/an-introduction-to-stochastic-calculus/">here</a>).
Entropy is a topic that comes up all over the place from physics to information
theory, and of course, machine learning.  I written about it in various
different forms but always taken it as a given as the "expected information".
Well I found a few of good explanations about how to "derive" it and thought
that I should share.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll be showing a few of derivations of the maximum entropy
principle, where entropy appears as part of the definition.  These derivations
will show why it is a reasonable and natural thing to maximize, and how it is
determined from some well thought out reasoning.  This post will be more math
heavy but hopefully it will give you more insight into this wonderfully
surprising topic.</p>

<p>After being busy for the first part of the year, I finally have a bit of time
to work on this blog.  After a lot of thinking about how to best fit it into my
schedule, I've decided to <em>attempt</em> to write shorter posts.  Although I do get
a lot of satisfaction writing long posts, it's not practical because of the
time commitment.  Better to break it up into smaller parts to be able to
"ship" often rather than perfect each post.
This also allows me to experiment with smaller scoped topics, which hopefully
will keep more more motivated as well.  Speaking of which...</p>
<p>This post is about answering a random thought I had the other day: what would
happen if I kept passing an LLM's output back to itself?  I ran a few
experiments of trying to get the LLM to iteratively summarize or rephrase a
piece of text and the results are...  pretty much what you would expect.  But
if you don't know what to expect, then read on and find out what happened!</p>

<p>One interesting thing I often think about is the gap between academic and real-world
solutions.  In general academic solutions play in the realm of idealized problem
spaces, removing themselves from needing to care about the messiness of the real-world.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>
competitions are a (small) step in the right direction towards dealing with messiness,
usually providing a true blind test set (vs. overused benchmarks), and opening a
few degrees of freedom in terms the techniques that can be used, which
usually eschews novelty in favour of more robust methods.  To this end, I
thought it would be useful to take a look at a more realistic problem (via a
Kaggle competition) and understand the practical details that result in a
superior solution.</p>
<p>This post will cover the <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05351">first place solution</a> [<a class="reference internal" href="posts/a-look-at-the-first-place-solution-of-a-dermatology-classification-kaggle-competition/#id2">1</a>] to the

In addition to using tried and true architectures (mostly EfficientNets), they
have some interesting tactics they use to formulate the problem, process the
data, and train/validate the model.  I'll cover background on the
ML techniques, competition and data, architectural details, problem formulation, and
implementation.  I've also run some experiments to better understand the
benefits of certain choices they made.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>Unless you've been living under a rock, you've probably heard of large language
models (LLM) such as ChatGPT or Bard.  I'm not one for riding a hype train but
I do think LLMs are here to stay and either are going to have an impact as big
as mobile as an interface (my current best guess) or perhaps something as big as
the Internet itself.  In either case, it behooves me to do a bit more
investigation into this popular trend <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/building-a-qa-bot-of-me-with-openai-and-cloudflare/#id2" id="id1">1</a>.  At the same time, there are a bunch
of other developer technologies that I've been wondering about like serverless
computing, modern dev tools, and LLM-based code assistants, so I thought why not
kill multiple birds with one stone.</p>
<p>This post is going to describe how I built a question and answering bot of myself using
LLMs as well as my experience using the relevant developer tools such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Github Copilot</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers</a>, and a couple of other related ones.
I start out with my motivation for doing this project, some brief background
on the technologies, a description of how I built everything including some
evaluation on LLM outputs, and finally some commentary.  This post is a lot
less heavy on the math as compared to my previous ones but it still has some
good stuff so read on!</p>

<p>After a long digression, I'm finally back to one of the main lines of research
that I wanted to write about.  The two main ideas in this post are not that
recent but have been quite impactful (one of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2021/test-of-time/11808">papers</a> won a recent ICML
test of time award).  They address two of the topics that are near and dear to
my heart: Bayesian learning and scalability.  Dare I even ask who wouldn't be
interested in the intersection of these topics?</p>
<p>This post is about two techniques to perform scalable Bayesian inference.  They
both address the problem using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) but in very
different ways.  One leverages the observation that SGD plus some noise will
converge to Bayesian posterior sampling <a class="citation-reference" href="posts/bayesian-learning-via-stochastic-gradient-langevin-dynamics-and-bayes-by-backprop/#welling2011" id="id1">[Welling2011]</a>, while the other generalizes the
"reparameterization trick" from variational autoencoders to enable non-Gaussian
posterior approximations <a class="citation-reference" href="posts/bayesian-learning-via-stochastic-gradient-langevin-dynamics-and-bayes-by-backprop/#blundell2015" id="id2">[Blundell2015]</a>.  Both are easily implemented in the modern deep
learning toolkit thus benefit from the massive scalability of that toolchain.
As usual, I will go over the necessary background (or refer you to my previous
posts), intuition, some math, and a couple of toy examples that I implemented.</p>
