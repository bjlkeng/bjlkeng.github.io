<p>During my undergraduate days, one of the most interesting courses I took was on
coding and compression.  Here was a course that combined algorithms,
probability and secret messages, what's not to like? <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/lossless-compression-with-asymmetric-numeral-systems/#id2" id="id1">1</a> I ended up not going
down that career path, at least partially because communications systems had
its heyday around the 2000s with companies like Nortel and Blackberry and its
predecessors (some like to joke that all the major theoretical breakthroughs
were done by Shannon and his discovery of information theory around 1950).  Fortunately, I
eventually wound up studying industrial applications of classical AI techniques
and then machine learning, which has really grown like crazy in the last 10
years or so.  Which is exactly why I was so surprised that a <em>new</em> and <em>better</em>
method of lossless compression was developed in 2009 <em>after</em> I finished my
undergraduate degree when I was well into my PhD.  It's a bit mind boggling that
something as well-studied as entropy-based lossless compression still had
(have?) totally new methods to discover, but I digress.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to write about a relatively new entropy based encoding
method called Asymmetrical Numeral Systems (ANS) developed by Jaroslaw (Jarek)
Duda [2].  If you've ever heard of Arithmetic Coding (probably best known for
its use in JPEG compression), ANS runs in a very similar vein.  It can
generate codes that are close to the theoretical compression limit
(similar to Arithmetic coding) but is <em>much</em> more efficient.  It's been used in
modern compression algorithms since 2014 including compressors developed
by Facebook, Apple and Google [3].  As usual, I'm going to go over some
background, some math, some examples to help with intuition, and finally some
experiments with a toy ANS implementation I wrote.  I hope you're as
excited as I am, let's begin!</p>

<p>One of the big criticisms of modern machine learning is that it's essentially
a blackbox -- data in, prediction out, that's it.  And in some sense, how could
it be any other way?  When you have a highly non-linear model with high degrees
of interactions, how can you possibly hope to have a simple understanding of
what the model is doing?  Well, turns out there is an interesting (and
practical) line of research along these lines.</p>
<p>This post will dive into the ideas of a popular technique published in the last
few years call <em>SHapely Additive exPlanations</em> (or SHAP).  It builds upon
previous work in this area by providing a unified framework to think
about explanation models as well as a new technique with this framework that
uses Shapely values.  I'll go over the math, the intuition, and how it works.
No need for an implementation because there is already a nice little Python
package! Confused yet?  Keep reading and I'll <em>explain</em>.</p>

<p>One of the things that I find is usually missing from many ML papers is how
they relate to the fundamentals.  There's always a throwaway line where it
assumes something that is not at all obvious (see my post on
<a class="reference external" href="posts/importance-sampling-and-estimating-marginal-likelihood-in-variational-autoencoders/">Importance Sampling</a>).  I'm the kind of person who likes to
understand things to a satisfactory degree (it's literally in the subtitle of
the blog) so I couldn't help myself investigating a minor idea I read about in
a paper.</p>
<p>This post investigates how to use continuous density outputs (e.g. a logistic
or normal distribution) to model discrete image data (e.g. 8-bit RGB values).
It seems like it might be something obvious such as setting the loss as the
average log-likelihood of the continuous density and that's <em>almost</em> the
whole story.  But leaving it at that skips over so many (interesting) and
non-obvious things that you would never know if you didn't bother to look.  I'm
a curious fellow so come with me and let's take a look!</p>

<p>It's been a long time coming but I'm finally getting this post out!  I read
this paper a couple of years ago and wanted to really understand it because it
was state of the art at the time (still pretty close even now).  As usual
though, once I started down the variational autoencoder line of posts, there
was always <em>yet</em> another VAE paper to look into so I never got around to
looking at this one.</p>
<p>This post is all about a proper probabilistic generative model called Pixel
Convolutional Neural Networks or PixelCNN.  It was originally proposed
as a side contribution of Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks in [1] and later
expanded upon in [2,3] (and I'm sure many other papers).  The real cool thing
about it is that it's (a) probabilistic, and (b) autoregressive.  It's still
counter-intuitive to me that you can generate images one pixel at at time, but
I'm jumping ahead of myself here.  We'll go over some background material, the
method, and my painstaking attempts at an implementation (and what I learned
from it).  Let's get started!</p>

<p>It took a while but I'm back!  This post is kind of a digression (which seems
to happen a lot) along my journey of learning more about probabilistic
generative models.  There's so much in ML that you can't help learning a lot
of random things along the way.  That's why it's interesting, right?</p>
<p>Today's topic is <em>importance sampling</em>.  It's a really old idea that you may
have learned in a statistics class (I didn't) but somehow is useful in deep learning,
what's old is new right?  How this is relevant to the discussion is that when
we have a large latent variable model (e.g. a variational
autoencoder), we want to be able to efficiently estimate the marginal likelihood
given data.  The marginal likelihood is kind of taken for granted in the
experiments of some VAE papers when comparing different models.  I was curious
how it was actually computed and it took me down this rabbit hole.  Turns out
it's actually pretty interesting!  As usual, I'll have a mix of background
material, examples, math and code to build some intuition around this topic.
Enjoy!</p>
