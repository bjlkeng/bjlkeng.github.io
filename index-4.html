<p>Even though it was just a scant few years ago, my research in grad school seems
like it was from another lifetime.  Nowadays I deal with data and most of my
code revolves around manipulating and extracting interesting insights from it.
However in my previous life I spent quite a bit of time dealing with
satisfiability problems.  So before I start writing about data and related
topics, I thought I'd kick it old school and write about some topics from my
formative years.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p><br></p>
<h4> Decision, P, NP and NP-Complete Problems </h4>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Feel free to skip this section if you're already familiar with these
topics.</em></p>
<p>Before we get into some of the more heavy stuff, let's review some of the
"basic" concepts that will help us put the satisfiability problem in context.
I'm going to skip a lot of the formal math that typically comes from the branch
of compute science called the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">theory of computation</a>.  Instead, I'm going to
try to explain it in a simpler way -- or at least in the way that I understand it <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id13" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental problems in computing is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem">decision problem</a>: something that has a yes/no
answer.  We can think of solving a decision problem as taking a realization
of that problem, also known as an <em>instance</em>, as input and writing
an algorithm that spit out the yes/no output (image from Wikipedia):</p>
<img alt="decision problem" class="align-center" src="images/decision_problem.png" style="height: 250px;"><p>Pretty simple, huh?  Now there are other types of problems like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_problem">function
problems</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem">optimization
problems</a> but you
probably have some intuition that decision problems are something
fundamental that we should be studying <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id14" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> How fast can you go? </h5>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea of what decision problems are, we can talk about the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">computational complexity</a>
of these problems.  It's actually much more intuitive than it sounds.  Basically,
we want to answer questions about how many resources (e.g. CPU run-time,
memory, network bandwidth, circuit size etc.) will be needed to solve a
particular decision problem.  Seems like a reasonable thing to investigate.
For now, let's just focus on one of these aspects: run-time.  Our goal here is
to classify different types of problems in terms of how easy (or hard) they are
to solve in terms of run-time.</p>
<p>If you've done any study of algorithms, you probably have a rough idea of the
idea of polynomial time problems.  Roughly speaking, if you can write a program
to solve a decision problem (correctly) and its run-time scales polynomially
with the size of the input, then you've got a polynomial time decision problem.
Another name for this class of decision problems is "<strong>P</strong>".
For example, let's define a decision problem <cite>FINDX</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<cite>FINDX</cite>: Does an array of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> integers <span class="math">\(A = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\)</span> contain integer <span class="math">\(x\)</span>?</blockquote>
<p><cite>FINDX</cite> is in the class of decision problems <strong>P</strong> because it's simple to write
an algorithm that gives a yes/no answer in linear time in the size of the array
<span class="math">\(A\)</span> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id15" id="id3">[3]</a>.  A more succinct way of saying this is that <cite>FINDX</cite> is in <strong>P</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> NP What? </h5>
<p>So up to this point, I think most programmers will have a reasonable
understanding of these concepts.  Where it gets hairy is when we start talking
about <strong>NP</strong> problems.  The underlying idea is not complicated but it is,
well, strange.</p>
<p>When we write code, most of us are thinking about how to solve a problem.  It's
quite natural to do so and, in fact, we've defined a set of problems based on
how fast we can solve them, the class of problems called <strong>P</strong>.  However,
<strong>NP</strong> problems are defined differently.  It's not about how fast we can solve a
problem, but how fast we can <em>verify</em> a potential answer to the problem <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id16" id="id4">[4]</a>.
In particular, <strong>NP</strong> is about how fast we can verify a potential
answer (and proof of that answer) is correct.  Say what?</p>
<p>Let's look back at our example to make a bit more sense of this definition.  If
we take the above example above of finding <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in an array <span class="math">\(A\)</span>,
we're not trying to figure out a solution to this problem, we're trying to
figure out something different:</p>
<blockquote>
Given <span class="math">\(A = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\)</span>, we are told that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in
<span class="math">\(A\)</span> and some proof (like the index into <span class="math">\(A\)</span> where <cite>x</cite> is), can
we write an algorithm (in polynomial time) to figure out if what we are
told is correct?</blockquote>
<p>It turns out, yes, we can write that algorithm: we just need to look up the
index where <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is said to be.  So we would say, that <cite>FINDX</cite> is in
(the class of decision problems called) <strong>NP</strong>.</p>
<p>Stop and think about this for a second.  To figure out if <cite>FINDX</cite> was an <strong>NP</strong>
problem, we didn't look at how easy it was to solve, but rather how easy it was
to verify a potential solution was correct!?  Why would we ever want to define
problems in such strange, roundabout way?</p>
<p>It turns out that many important, naturally arising problems can be classified
as <strong>NP</strong>.  Here are some more examples (try to see if you figure out why these
would be classified as <strong>NP</strong> problems <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id17" id="id5">[5]</a> ):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>"Is an array of integers sorted?" (might want something like this for binary search)</li>
<li>"Is there a path from vertex <span class="math">\(s\)</span> to vertex <span class="math">\(t\)</span> in graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span>?" (something that you might want to do in a program like Google Maps).</li>
<li>"Given a Boolean formula, is there an assignment to the variables to make the formula true?"</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is of particular note because that is what we're going to be
talking about in the next section.  Also note, that we saw that <cite>FINDX</cite> was
in both <strong>P</strong> and <strong>NP</strong>.  The more general result is that all all decision
problems in <strong>P</strong> are in <strong>NP</strong> (but most likely not the other way around) <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id18" id="id6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>There's one last concept that I should mention and that's the idea of
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problems (<strong>NPC</strong> for short).  Without going into too much
detail, a good way to think about it is as the "hardest problems" in <strong>NP</strong>.
In the examples above, the problems that are in <strong>P</strong> (e.g. <cite>FINDX</cite>) are
typically considered "easy".  Whereas the last problem is considered "hard".
Suffice it to say, <strong>NPC</strong> problems are important because they arise naturally
in many contexts and are "hard" to solve.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> NP is <em>not</em> "not polynomial" </h5>
<p>Before we end this section, a <em>very</em> important caution: NP does <strong>not</strong> stand
for "non-polynomial" or "not polynomial", as one would intuitively think.
<strong>P</strong> stands for (roughly) polynomial time, so doesn't it make sense for the
"N" in <strong>NP</strong> to stand for "non-" or "not"?  Nope, apparently not.
I agree though that it's not a great name now-a-days much to the chagrin of
students new to computational complexity (it does make more sense using another
definition of <strong>NP</strong> though) .</p>
<p><strong>NP</strong> actually stands for "<em>non-deterministic polynomial time</em>".  The details
aren't too important but the big takeaway is this: <strong>NP-Complete</strong> problems <em>probably</em>
have no polynomial time solution in the worse case.  But as we saw, <strong>P</strong>
problems are a subset of <strong>NP</strong> problems so at least some <strong>NP</strong> problems can
be solved in polynomial time.  Basically,
<strong>NPC</strong> <span class="math">\(\approx\)</span> problems with no polynomial time solution (probably);
<strong>P</strong> <span class="math">\(=\)</span> polynomial time problems.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Satisfiability </h4>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed some theoretical ideas around <strong>NPC</strong>
problems and how they can be really difficult (e.g. probably exponential time
in the worse case).  However, in many cases the <strong>NPC</strong> problems we come across
rarely get into this worse case behavior, allowing us to practically solve some
rather interesting problems.  Let's take a look at a particular <strong>NPC</strong> problem
and some of its applications to see why this might be the case.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> Boolean Satisfiability </h5>
<p>One of the most important <strong>NPC</strong> problems (and in fact the very first one
to be proven <strong>NPC</strong>) is the <em>Boolean Satisfiability Problem</em> or <em>SAT</em> for short.
The definition from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A propositional logic formula (<span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>), also called Boolean expression, is built from
variables, operators AND (conjunction, also denoted by ∧), OR (disjunction, ∨),
NOT (negation, ¬), and parentheses. A formula is said to be satisfiable if it
can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate logical values (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to
its variables. The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is, given a formula, to
check whether it is satisfiable.</blockquote>
<p>So basically, given a Boolean formula with Boolean variables, can we find an
assignment to the variables to make it true.  A trivial example of a SAT
instance might look like Eqn. 1 (recall <span class="math">\(\wedge\)</span> means "AND"; <span class="math">\(\vee\)</span> means "OR):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\phi := x_0 \wedge x_1 \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It's trivial to see how we could make <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> true (just set <span class="math">\(x_0=1, x_1=1\)</span>).</p>
<p>Before moving on to some applications of SAT, let's just convince ourselves
that SAT is in <strong>NP</strong>.  So given a Boolean formula (e.g. <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>), and a
potential solution (e.g. <span class="math">\(x_0=1, x_1=1\)</span>), can we verify that the
potential solution is correct in polynomial time?  Yes, take a look at the
footnote for a brief explanation <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id19" id="id7">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>Practically though, we rarely care if we can <em>verify</em> a potential solution
in polynomial time; we usually just care about finding <em>a solution</em>
i.e. the values of <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> that make <span class="math">\(\phi=1\)</span>.
A naive algorithm is just try all possible values of the input variables.
So for Eqn. 1, we could just try <span class="math">\((x_0=0, x_1=0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x_0=0, x_1=1)\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(,(x_0=1, x_1=0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x_0=1, x_1=1),\)</span>
and see if any yield <span class="math">\(\phi=1\)</span>.
It's not too hard to see that there are <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> possible values for
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> Boolean variables <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id20" id="id8">[8]</a>.  Leading us to an exponential algorithm in
the worse case.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't really know of a better algorithm that can find a solution to
SAT in less than exponential time (in the worse case).  Most modern SAT
algorithms use some smarter ways to explore the exponential space of variable
values but invariably, they must try an exponential number assignments in the
worse case.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this worse case scenario is that in many domains it
doesn't really apply <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id21" id="id9">[9]</a>.  SAT is widely used in many applications (some of which
we'll describe below) despite this theoretical worse case scenario.  Through
a combination of clever engineering <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id22" id="id10">[10]</a> and application of theory, SAT
solvers have become increasingly efficient at solving many practical problems
across a variety of domains.  We should never forget the old adage:</p>
<blockquote>
In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h5> From Bits to Bytes </h5>
<p>So now that we know a bit more about SAT, how the heck is this going to help us
solve problems we actually care about?  To answer that, let's remember how
digital computers are built: at the lowest level, we have atoms; at the next
level we have transistors; but at the level we actually care about we have
logic gates i.e. AND, OR, NOT gates, the same operators we used in our Boolean
formula!</p>
<p>From these basic logic gates, we can start building more complicated formulas
that represent higher level questions.  For instance, imagine we have
three 8-bit numbers <span class="math">\(A_2, B_2, C_2\)</span> (the subscript 2 reminds us that
we're dealing with binary numbers), and we want to do some addition, we could
encode this in a SAT formula that might abstractly look like Eqn. 2:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\phi := ADDER_8(A_2, B_2, C_2) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Here <span class="math">\(ADDER_8\)</span> is a 8-bit hardware <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_%28electronics%29">adder</a>,
that takes two 8-bit numbers <span class="math">\(A_2, B_2\)</span> and produces an 8-bit number <cite>C_2</cite>.
So if we encode Eqn. 2 as a SAT instance and send it to a SAT solver, it will
return "SAT" and give us back values for <span class="math">\(A_2, B_2, C_2\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(A + B = C\)</span> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id23" id="id11">[11]</a>!
Still not quite that useful since they'll be (from our point of view) random
values for the input numbers.</p>
<p>What we actually want is to start asking us more interesting questions,
see if you can guess what this encodes (dropping the subscript 2 here
for readability, but let's not forget we're dealing with Boolean variables here):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\phi := ADDER_8(A, B, C) \wedge (A = 6) \wedge (B = 9) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If we send this to the SAT solver, we'll get a "SAT" result with <span class="math">\(C=15\)</span> (in binary).
We've effectively implemented 6 + 9 using Eqn. 3.</p>
<p>Okay, so still not that interesting.  How about this one?</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\phi := &amp; ADDER_8(A, B, C) \wedge \\
        &amp; (COMPARATOR_8(C, A) \vee COMPARATOR_8(C, B)) \tag{4}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Here <span class="math">\(COMPARATOR_8(X,Y)\)</span> is an 8-bit hardware <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_comparator">comparator</a>
implementing <span class="math">\(X &lt; Y\)</span>.  Now we're getting somewhere.  We're asking a much
more interesting question:</p>
<blockquote>
Are there any (8-bit values) of <span class="math">\(A, B, C\)</span>, such that the sum
(<span class="math">\(C\)</span>) is less than one of its addends (<span class="math">\(A, B\)</span>)?</blockquote>
<p>Do you think this instance should be SAT (i.e. at least one assignment of
values for <span class="math">\(A, B, C\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\phi=1\)</span>) or UNSAT (no such values
exist)? See <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/accessible-satisfiability/#id24" id="id12">[12]</a> for the answer.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> From Bytes to Code </h5>
<p>We saw above how we can use SAT to start asking some basic questions
around fixed-width arithmetic.  We can extend this to much more complicated
ideas.  For one, all programming languages operate on bits and bytes, so we
should be able to ask questions about code too right?  Let's take a look
at how we can encode some basic structures first.</p>
<p>As a first example, we could build a SAT an instance that looked very similar
to the one from the last subsection by translating some C code (except the
variables might be signed 32-bit numbers instead of unsigned 8-bit numbers):</p>

</pre></td>

<p>Notice that the <cite>assert</cite> is a property we want to guarantee <em>for all</em> possible
values of <cite>x, y, z</cite>, but our SAT instance can only tell us if there <em>exists</em> one
possible way for that to happen.  So instead, we'll flip the question around
and actually ask the SAT solver something like this:</p>
<table class="codetable"><tr>

</pre></td>
</tr></table>
<p>Which is just negating what we had in our original <cite>assert</cite> statement making
it a suitable question to ask a SAT solver.  And voila, we've just asked
the same question as above except on equivalent C code.
This process of verifying properties about some piece of code (or more
generally any system) is called
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal verification</a>.
It can help us "prove" correctness about various types of systems like
cryptographic protocols, digital circuits, or code as we just saw.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> What (about) <cite>if</cite>'s? </h5>
<p>Obviously code can get much more complicated than the small snippet above.
I won't go into too much more detail but I do want to cover another concept
that will help us deal with <cite>if</cite> statements.  Let's look at the following
snippet:</p>

<p>Here we have two new structures that cause some issues: (a) the re-assignment
of y, and (b) the <cite>if-else</cite> statement.  However, both can handled without too
much trouble.  The easiest way to see this is do some transformations on the
code to make it more amenable to SAT.  Here's one way to do it:</p>

<p>There are a couple of things going on here.  First, we use a bunch
of intermediate variables for all of the computations that we're doing.
Remember, we have to translate this code down to bits (Boolean variables)
that must all exist within one Boolean formula.  There is no concept of
sequential operations, so we have additional variables to represent every
intermediate computation we do.  This is not unlike how we think about building
digital logic.</p>
<p>Second, we use a hardware structure called a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer">multiplexor</a>
that effectively implements an <cite>if-else</cite> statement.  It can be built from logic gates,
so we'll have no trouble putting it into our Boolean formula.
Here's an image from Wikipedia that visualizes it:</p>
<img alt="multiplexor" class="align-center" src="images/mux.png" style="height: 250px;"><p>Here, we set <span class="math">\(A=y\_2a, B=y\_2b, Z=y\_3,\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_0=(y&gt;=0)\)</span>.  When
<span class="math">\(S_0=0\)</span>, it constrains (remember we're in the context of a Boolean
formula) <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, when <span class="math">\(S_0=1\)</span>, it constrains <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, we could build a large Boolean formula that effectively
asks the question:</p>
<blockquote>
Is it possible for <span class="math">\(y\_3\)</span> to be less than or equal to 0 for the above code snippet?</blockquote>
<p>Pretty cool huh?  Of course, industrial strength formal verification tools will
use much more complicated techniques and can handle many more types of code
structures (like loops).  One of the big limitations (and probably a big research area)
is scaling these problems.  You can imagine that trying to ask questions
about the Linux kernel might become untenable due to the size of the problem.</p>
<p>If you're interested you should check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.satisfiability.org/">SAT conference</a>
where they have many more interesting types of topics around satisfiability
and its applications.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> Satisfiability Modulo Theories </h5>
<p>One last idea that I want to talk about before we end this section is that
of other types of satisfiability problems.  In the above discussion,
we talked exclusively about Boolean Satisfiability -- formulas that
only use Boolean variables.  However, there are many more types of satisfiability
problems.  One quite natural extension is instead of just using Boolean
variables, replace them with other types of "things" like real numbers,
integers, list, arrays etc.  These "things" are more formally called
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_%28mathematical_logic%29">theories</a>,
and allow us to ask higher level "questions" rather than trying to
convert everything down to the bit level.  These satisfiability
decision problems are usually referred to as
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)</a> problems.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to note is that while you might expect that
this higher level of abstraction would allow us to solve problems
more efficiently, the solvers for these other types of SAT problems are much
more complicated.  This complexity causes some issues in trying to find good
heuristics to efficiently solve these types of problems.  In many cases, the
best solution is still to just reduce your problem down to bits and use Boolean
SAT, which can do much more fine grained optimizations.  In fact, many SMT
solvers do use a Boolean SAT solver as the underlying solving engine (with some
nice things on top).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Conclusion </h4>
<p>I spent quite a few years learning about SAT and its applications.
It's quite an elegant topic because it is a direct application
of what appears to be a rather theoretical and core problem of computer
science.  Hopefully this article helps introduce some of the ideas that took me
years to digest in an easy to understand way.  Sometimes theory is just theory,
but in this case, theory really does lead to practice.</p>

So one way of thinking about it is: if we somehow figure out that a yes/no decision problem is hard, then we can reasonably conclude that the function/optimization "version" of the problem is also hard.  Of course it's a bit more complicated but that's how I like to think about it.</td>

The core solver is about 1000 lines of C (with comments) and for a while was the go-to SAT solver for anything to do with SAT.  It was (is?) incredibly fast beating most of the solvers at the time, primarily though clever code/memory optimizations.  I did a bunch of hacking on this code during graduate school and it's surprisingly easy to work with (mostly because of it's small size).  Of course, now-a-days there are faster SAT solvers (many of which are built on top of MiniSat) but it's still quite a robust solution if you need something simple to start with.</td>
