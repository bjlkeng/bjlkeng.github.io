    "Games and gambling have been part of human cultures around the world for millennia.  Nowadays, the connection between games of chance and mathematics (in particular probability) are so obvious that it is taught to school children.  However, the mathematics of games and gambling only started to formally [develop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling#History) in the 17th century with the works of multiple mathematicians such as Fermat and Pascal.  It is then no wonder that many incorrect beliefs around gambling have formed that are \"intuitive\" from a layman's perspective but fail to pass muster when applying the rigor of mathematics.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we should note that for `num_flips=4`, we would (correctly) expect roughly \\\\(2\\\\) out of \\\\(4\\\\) flips to be heads.  But what about a heads after heads?  For a given number of heads (first column), for example \\\\(2\\\\), it is impossible to get \\\\(2\\\\) or more heads (fourth column).  Likewise, the total number of flips after H must be less than or equal to \\\\(2\\\\).  So the ratio of the two leads to an empirical probability that is strictly less than \\\\(\\frac{2}{4}\\\\).  This big constraint of a short run of flips over represents tails for a given amount of heads.  We saw that as we increase the run length (`num_flips` in our code), the probability approaches the expected 50/50 distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why does increasing the number of experiments (`N` in our code) not work as per our expectation of the law of large numbers?  The issue is that our \"unit\" of measurement is not a single flip, but rather independent short sequences of flips (in our case \\\\(4\\\\)).  In this case, we just repeatedly run into this bias for each independent experiment we perform, regardless of how many times it is run.  A different setup where each of the short runs were concatenated together would produce the 50/50 split our intuition expects effectively removing the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Psychology of Gambler's Fallacy\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons why this bias is so insidious is that, as humans, we naturally tend to update our beliefs on finite sequences of observations.  Imagine the roulette wheel with the electronic display.  When looking for patterns, most people will just take a glance at the current 10 numbers and make a mental note of it.  Five minutes later, they may do the same thing.  This leads to precisely the bias that we saw above of using short sequences to infer the overall probability of a situation.  Thus, the more \"observations\" they make, the strong the tendency to fall for the Gambler's Fallacy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are ways around making this mistake.  As we saw, the most straight forward is to observe longer sequences.  However, there's reason to believe that this is not practical given the limitations of human attention span and memory.  Another method is to just do straight counts of the favorable outcomes and total outcomes (instead of computing interim probabilities after each \"observation\" like we did in our experiment), and then just compute the probability of this composite sample.  This leads to the expected true long-run probability.  Again, this bumps up against the limitations of human attention and memory.  Probably the best way is to use external aids (e.g. pen and paper, computer) to properly record and compute the probability.  Unfortunately, casinos are not as sympathetic to this solution."

    "Probability is far from a natural line of human thinking.  Humans do have limited capacities in attention span and memory, which bias the observations we make and fool us into such fallacies such as the Gambler's Fallacy.  Even with knowledge of probability, it is easy to be misled into an incorrect line of thinking.  The best we can do is be aware of these biases and take extra measures to avoid them.  \n",
