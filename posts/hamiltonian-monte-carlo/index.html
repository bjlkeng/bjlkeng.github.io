<p>Here's a topic I thought that I would never get around to learning because it was "too hard".
When I first started learning about Bayesian methods, I knew enough that I
should learn a thing or two about MCMC since that's the backbone
of most Bayesian analysis; so I learned something about it
(see my <a class="reference external" href="../markov-chain-monte-carlo-mcmc-and-the-metropolis-hastings-algorithm/">previous post</a>).
But I didn't dare attempt to learn about the infamous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
Even though it is among the standard algorithms used in Bayesian inference, it
always seemed too daunting because it required "advanced physics" to
understand.  As usual, things only seem hard because you don't know them yet.
After having some time to digest MCMC methods, getting comfortable learning
more maths (see
<a class="reference external" href="../tensors-tensors-tensors/">here</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="../manifolds/">here</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="../hyperbolic-geometry-and-poincare-embeddings/">here</a>),
all of a sudden learning "advanced physics" didn't seem so tough (but there
sure was a lot of background needed)!</p>
<p>This post is the culmination of many different rabbit holes (many much deeper
than I needed to go) where I'm going to attempt to explain HMC in simple and
intuitive terms to a satisfactory degree (that's the tag line of this blog
after all).  I'm going to begin by briefly motivating the topic by reviewing
MCMC and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm then move on to explaining
Hamiltonian dynamics (i.e., the "advanced physics"), and finally discuss the HMC
algorithm along with some toy experiments I put together.  Most of the material
is based on [1] and [2], which I've found to be great sources for their
respective areas.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6"><span class="sectnum">1.1</span> Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a></h3>
<p>This section is going to give a brief overview of MCMC and the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  For a more detailed treatment, see my
<a class="reference external" href="../markov-chain-monte-carlo-mcmc-and-the-metropolis-hastings-algorithm/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are a class of techniques that use
Markov chains to sample from a target probability distribution ("Monte Carlo").
The main idea is that you construct a Markov Chain such that the steady state
distribution of the Markov Chain approximates your target distribution.
The samples from your target distribution can then be generated just by
traversing that Markov Chain.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Visualization of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo" src="../../images/mcmc.png" style="height: 270px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1: Visualization of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Figure 1 shows a crude visualization of the idea.  The "states" of the Markov Chain
are the support of your probability distribution (the figure only shows
states with discrete values for simplicity but they can also be continuous).
Three important conditions that are required to construct a Markov chain
that can be used for MCMC are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Irreducible</strong>: We must be able to reach any one state from any other state
eventually (i.e. the expected number of steps is finite).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aperiodic</strong>: The system never returns to the same state with a fixed
period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reversible (aka Detailed Balance)</strong>: A Markov chain is called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance#Reversible_Markov_chains">reversible</a>
if the Markov chain has a stationary distribution <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\(\pi_i T(i|j) = \pi_j T(j|i)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(T(i|j)\)</span> is the transition
probability from state <span class="math">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi_i\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\pi_j\)</span> are the equilibrium probabilities for their respective states.
This condition is known as the <em>detailed balance</em> condition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two properties define a Markov chain which is
<a class="reference external" href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/definition-1.html">ergodic</a>,
which implies that there is a steady state distribution.
The third property is used to ensure that the Markov chain can be used in an MCMC algorithm.</p>
<p>One of the earliest MCMC algorithms was the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm">Metropolis-Hastings algorithm</a>
(see my <a class="reference external" href="../markov-chain-monte-carlo-mcmc-and-the-metropolis-hastings-algorithm/">previous post</a> for a derivation).
This algorithm is nice because you don't need the actual probability
density, call it <span class="math">\(p(x)\)</span>, but rather only a function that is
proportional to it (<span class="math">\(f(x) \propto p(x)\)</span>).
Assuming that the state space of the Markov Chain is the support of your target
probability distribution, the algorithm gives a method to select the next state
to traverse.  It does this by introducing two new distributions: a <em>proposal
distribution</em> <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> and an <em>acceptance distribution</em> <span class="math">\(A(x)\)</span>.  The
proposal distribution only needs to have the same support as your target
distribution, although it's much more efficient if it has a similar shape.  The
acceptance distribution is defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
A(y | x) = min(1, \frac{f(y)g(x | y)}{f(x)g(y | x)}) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(y\)</span> being the newly proposed state sampled from your proposal distribution <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span>.
The <span class="math">\(y | x\)</span> notation means that the proposal distribution is conditioned
on the current state (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>) with a proposed transition to the next state (<span class="math">\(y\)</span>).
The idea is that the proposal distribution will change depending on the current
state.  A common choice is a normal distribution centered on <span class="math">\(x\)</span> with a
standard deviation dependent on the problem instance.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be summarized as such:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Initialize the initial state by picking a random <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Propose a new state <span class="math">\(y\)</span> according to <span class="math">\(g(y | x)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept state <span class="math">\(y\)</span> with uniform probability according to <span class="math">\(A(y | x)\)</span>.
If accepted transition to state <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, otherwise stay in state <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to step 2 (repeat <span class="math">\(T\)</span> times).</p></li>
<li><p>Save the current state as a sample, repeat steps 2-4 to sample another point.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that in step 4 we throw away a bunch of samples before we return one in step 5.
This is because sequential samples will be typically be correlated,
which is the opposite of what we want.  So we throw away a bunch of samples in
hopes that the sample we pick is sufficiently independent.  Theoretically, as we
approach an infinite number of samples this doesn't make a difference, but
practically we need it in order to generate random independent samples with a finite run.</p>
<p>To make MH efficient, you want your proposal distribution to accept with
a high probability (so that you can make <span class="math">\(T\)</span> small),
otherwise you get stuck in the same state and it takes a very long time for the
algorithm to converge.  This means you want <span class="math">\(g(y|x) \approx f(y)\)</span>.
If they are approximately equal, then the fraction in Equation 1 is approximately 1
ensuring the acceptance rate (step 3) is relatively high,
but this isn't so easy to do. If we had a closed form for the density then we
could just sample from the original distribution directly, which would negate
the need for MCMC in the first place!  Fortunately, there are other algorithms
like HMC that can do better (in most cases).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7"><span class="sectnum">1.2</span> Motivation</a></h3>
<p>Let's take a look at the basic case of using a normal distribution as our
proposal distribution centered on our current state (in 1D).  We can see that
<span class="math">\(g(x | y) = g(y | x)\)</span> making our proposal symmetric.
In other words, the probability of jumping from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
is equal to the probability of jumping from <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.
So the fraction in Equation 1 then becomes simply <span class="math">\(\frac{f(y)}{f(x)}\)</span>.
This implies that you're more than likely to stick around in state <span class="math">\(x\)</span> if
it has a high density, and unlikely to move to state <span class="math">\(y\)</span> if it has low
density, which matches our intuition of what should happen.</p>
<p>This method is typically called "random walk" Metropolis-Hastings because
you're randomly selecting a point from your current location.  It works well in
some situations but it's not without its problems.  The main issue is that it
doesn't very efficiently explore the state space.  Figure 2 shows a
visualization of this idea.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Bimodal distribution" src="../../images/hmc_motivation.png" style="height: 270px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2: It's difficult to calibrate random walk MH algorithms</strong></p>
</div>
<p>From Figure 2, consider a bimodal distribution with a random walk MH algorithm.
If you start in one of the modes (left side) with a very tight proposal distribution (Proposal A),
you may get "stuck" in that mode without visiting the other mode.
Theoretically, you'll eventually end up in the other mode but practically you
might not get there with a finite MCMC run.
On the other hand, if you make the variance large (Proposal B) then in many
cases you'll end up proposing states where <span class="math">\(f(y)\)</span> is small, making the
acceptance rate from Equation 1 small.  There's no easy way around it,
there will always be this sort of trade-off and it's only exacerbated in higher
dimensions.</p>
<p>However, we've just been talking about random walk proposal distributions.
What if there was a better way?  Perhaps one where you can (theoretically)
get close to a 100% acceptance rate?  How about one where you don't need to throw
away any samples (Step 4 from MH algorithm above)?  Sounds too good to be true
doesn't it?  Yes, yes it is too good to be true, but we can <em>sort of</em> get there
with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo!  But let's not get ahead of ourselves, let's first
start with an explanation of Hamiltonian Dynamics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hamiltonian-mechanics">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8"><span class="sectnum">2</span> Hamiltonian Mechanics</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into Hamiltonian dynamics, let's do a quick review of high
school physics with Newton's second law of motion to understand how we can use
it to describe the motion of (macroscopic) objects.  Then we'll move on to
a more abstract method of describing these systems with Lagrangian mechanics.
Finally, we'll move on to Hamiltonian mechanics (and its approximations), which
can be considered as a modification of Lagrangian mechanics.  We'll see that
these concepts are not as scary as they sound, as long as we remember some
calculus and how to solve some relatively simple differential equations.</p>
<div class="section" id="classical-mechanics">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9"><span class="sectnum">2.1</span> Classical Mechanics</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics">Classical mechanics</a>
(or Newtonian mechanics) is the physical theory that describes the motion
of macroscopic objects like a ball, spaceship or even planetary bodies.
I won't go much into detail on classical mechanics and assume
you are familiar with the basic concepts from a first course in physics.</p>
<p>One of the main tools we use to describe motion in classical mechanics
is Newton's second law of motion:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\bf F_{net}} = m{\bf a(t)} = m\frac{d^2\bf x(t)}{dt^2} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Where <span class="math">\(\bf F_{net}\)</span> is the net force on an object, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is the mass
of the object, <span class="math">\(\bf a(t)\)</span> is the acceleration, <span class="math">\(\bf x(t)\)</span> is the
position (with respect a reference), and <strong>bold</strong> quantities are vectors.</p>
<p>Notice that Equation 2 is a differential equation, where <span class="math">\(\bf x(t)\)</span>
describes the equation of motion of the object over time.  In high school
physics you may not have had to solve differential equations.  Instead, you may
have been given equations to solve for <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span> assuming a constant
acceleration.  Now that we know better though, we can remove that
simplification and write things in terms of differential equations.</p>
<p>Note that I use the notation <span class="math">\(x'(t) := \frac{dx}{dt}\)</span> to always represent
the time derivative of the function <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span> (or later on <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(q\)</span>).  Most physics sources use the "dot" (<span class="math">\(\dot{x}(t)\)</span>) notation to
represent time derivatives but I'll use the apostrophe because I think it's probably
more familiar to non-physics readers.</p>
<p>I won't spend too much more time on this except to give a running example that
we'll use throughout the rest of this section.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-example-1-a-simple-harmonic-oscillator-using-classical-mechanics">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1: A Simple Harmonic Oscillator using classical mechanics.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Simple Harmonic Oscillator" src="../../images/hmc_mass_spring.gif" style="height: 200px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3: Simple Harmonic Oscillator (source: [3])</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Consider a mass (<span class="math">\(m\)</span>) suspended from a spring in Figure 3, where
<span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the force constant of the spring, and positive <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the
downward direction with <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> set at the spring's equilibrium.
Using Newton's second law (Equation 2), we get the following differential equation
(where acceleration is the second time derivative of position):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{F_{net}} = -kx + mg = m{a(t)} = m\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Rearranging:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} &amp;= -\frac{k}{m}x(t) + g \\
                      &amp;= -\frac{k}{m}(x(t) - x_0) &amp;&amp; \text{rename }x_0 := \frac{mg}{k} \\
                      &amp;= -\frac{k}{m}y(t)  &amp;&amp; \text{define } y(t) := x(t) - x_0 \\
\tag{4}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Here we are defining a new function <span class="math">\(y(t)\)</span> that is shifted by <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>.
This is basically the same as defining a new coordinate system shifted by
<span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> from our original one.
Notice that <span class="math">\(\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2} = \frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}\)</span>
since the constant vanishes with the derivative.  And so we end up with the
simplified differential equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{m}y(t) \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In this case, it's a second order differential equation with complex roots.
I'll spare you solving it from scratch and just point you to this excellent
<a class="reference external" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/ComplexRoots.aspx">set of notes</a>
by Paul Dawkins.  However, we can also just see by inspection that a solution
is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = Acos(\frac{k}{m}t + \phi) \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given an initial position and velocity, we can solve Equation 6 for the
particular constants.</p>
</div>
<p>Example 1 gives the general idea of how to find the motion of an object:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Calculate the net forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the (typically second order) differential equation from Equation 2 (Newton's second law).</p></li>
<li><p>Apply initial conditions (usually position and velocity) to find the constants.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out this is not the only way to find the equation(s) of motion.  The next section
gives us an alternative that is <em>sometimes</em> more convenient to use.</p>

<div class="section" id="lagrangian-mechanics">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10"><span class="sectnum">2.2</span> Lagrangian Mechanics</a></h3>
<p>Instead of using the classical formulation to solve the equation, we can use
the Lagrangian method.  It starts out by defining this strange quantity
called the <em>Lagrangian</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id3" id="id1">1</a>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
L\big(x(t), \frac{dx(t)}{dt}, t\big) = K - U = \text{Kinetic Energy} - \text{Potential Energy} \tag{7}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Where the Lagrangian is (typically) a function of the position <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span>,
its velocity <span class="math">\(\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\)</span>, and time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
It is kind of strange that we have a minus sign here and not a plus (which would give
the total energy) but it turns out that's what we want here.  We're going to
show that we can use the Lagrangian to
arrive at the same mathematical statement as Newton's second law by way of a
different method.  It's going to be a bit round about but we'll go through
several useful mathematical tools along the way (which will eventually lead us to
the Hamiltonian).</p>
<p>We'll start off by defining what is called the <em>action</em> that uses the Lagrangian:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
S[x(t)] &amp;= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\big(x(t),\frac{dx(t)}{dt}, t\big) dt \\
        &amp;= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(x(t),x'(t), t) dt &amp;&amp; \text{denote }  x'(t) := \frac{dx(t)}{dt} \\
\tag{8}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The astute reader will notice that Equation 8 is a functional.  Moreover, it's
precisely the functional defined by the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation#Statement">Euler-Lagrange equation</a>.
For those who have not studied this topic, I'll give a brief overview here but
direct you to my blog post on <a class="reference external" href="../the-calculus-of-variations/">the calculus of variations</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Equation 8 is what is called a <em>functional</em>: a function <span class="math">\(S[x(t)]\)</span> of a function <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span>,
where we use the square bracket to indicate a functional.  That is, if you plug in a function <span class="math">\(x_1(t)\)</span>
you get a scalar out <span class="math">\(S[x_1(t)]\)</span>;
if you plug in another function <span class="math">\(x_2(t)\)</span>, you get another scalar out <span class="math">\(S[x_2(t)]\)</span>.
It's a mapping from functions to scalars (as opposed to scalars to scalars).</p>
<p>Equation 8 depends only on the function <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span> (and it's derivative)
since <span class="math">\(t\)</span> gets integrated out.  Functionals have a lot of similarities to the traditional
functions we are used to in calculus, in particular they have the analogous concept of derivatives
called functional derivatives (denoted by <span class="math">\(\frac{\delta S}{\delta x}\)</span>).
One simple way to compute the functional derivative is to use the Euler-Lagrange equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\delta S[x]}{\delta x}
= \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x'} \tag{9}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Here I'm dropping the parameters of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to make things a
bit more readable.  Equation 9 can be computed using our usual rules of
calculus since <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is just a multivariate function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> (and not
a functional).  The proof of Equation 9 is pretty interesting but I'll refer
you to Chapter 6 of [2] if you're interested (which you can find online as a
sample chapter).</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-historical-remark">
<p class="admonition-title">Historical Remark</p>
<p>As with a lot of mathematics, the Euler-Lagrange equation has its roots in physics.
A young Lagrange at the age of 19 (!)
solved the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautochrone_curve">tautochrone problem</a>
in 1755 developing many of the mathematical ideas described here.  He later
sent it to Euler and they both developed the ideas further which led to
Lagrangian mechanics.  Euler saw the potential in Lagrange's work and realized
that the method could extend beyond mechanics, so he worked with Lagrange to
generalize it to apply to <em>any</em> functionals of that form, developing
variational calculus in the process.</p>
</div>
<p>So why did we introduce all of these seemingly random expressions?  It turns
out that they are useful in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary-action_principle">principle of least action</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The path taken by the system between times <span class="math">\(t_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t_2\)</span> and
configurations <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> is the one for which the <strong>action</strong> is <strong>stationary (i.e. no
change)</strong> to <strong>first order</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="math">\(t_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t_2\)</span> are the initial and final times, and
<span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> are the initial and final position.  It's sounds
fancy but what it's saying is that if you find a stationary function of Equation 8
(where the first functional derivative is zero) then it describes the motion of an object.
The derivation of it relies on quantum mechanics, which is beyond the scope of
this post (and my investigation on the subject).</p>
<p>However, if the principle of least action describes the motion then it should be equivalent
to the classical mechanics approach from the previous subsection -- and it indeed is equivalent!
We'll show this in the simple 1D case but it works in multiple dimensions and
with different coordinate bases as well.  Starting with a general Lagrangian (Equation 7)
for an object:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
L(x(t), x'(t), t) = K - U = \frac{1}{2}mx'^2(t) - U(x(t)) \tag{10}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Here we're using the standard kinetic energy formula (<span class="math">\(K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\)</span>, where velocity <span class="math">\(v=x'(t)\)</span>) and a
generalized potential function <span class="math">\(U(x(t))\)</span> that depends on the object's
position (e.g. gravity).  Plugging <span class="math">\(L\)</span> into the Euler-Lagrange (Equation 9)
and setting it to zero to find the stationary point, we get:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x'} &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x'} \\
\frac{\partial [\frac{1}{2}mx'^2(t) - U(x(t))]}{\partial x} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial [\frac{1}{2}mx'^2(t) - U(x(t))]}{\partial x'} \\
-\frac{\partial U(x(t))}{\partial x} &amp;= \frac{d[mx'(t)]}{dt} \\
-\frac{\partial U(x(t))}{\partial x} &amp;= mx''(t) \\
F = ma(t) &amp;&amp; \text{where }a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dx^2} \text{ and F}= -\frac{\partial U(x(t))}{\partial x} \\
\tag{11}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So we can see that we end up with Newton's second law of motion as we expected.
The negative sign comes in because if we decrease the potential (change in
potential is negative), we're moving in the direction of the potential field,
thus we have a positive force.</p>
<p>So we went through all of that to derive the same equation?  Pretty much, but in
certain cases the Lagrangian is easier to formulate and solve than the
classical approach (although not in the simple example below).  Additionally,
it is going to be useful to help us derive the Hamiltonian.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-example-2-a-simple-harmonic-oscillator-using-lagrangian-mechanics">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2: A Simple Harmonic Oscillator using Lagrangian mechanics.</p>
<p>Using the same problem in Example 1, let's solve it using the Lagrangian.
We can define the Lagrangian as (omitting the parameters for cleanliness):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
L = K - U = \frac{1}{2}mx'^2 - (-mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2) \tag{12}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where each term represents the velocity, gravitational potential and
elastic potential of the spring respectively.  Recall <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> is defined
to be where the spring is at rest and positive <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the downward
direction.  Thus, the gravitational potential is negative of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
direction while the spring has potential with any deviation from <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the Euler-Lagrange equation (and setting it to 0):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x'} \\
\frac{\partial [\frac{1}{2}mx'^2 - (-mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2)]}{\partial x} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial [\frac{1}{2}mx'^2 - (-mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2)]}{\partial x'} \\
mg - kx &amp;= mx'' \\
g - \frac{k}{m}x &amp;= x''  \\
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} &amp;= -\frac{k}{m}(x - x_0) &amp;&amp; \text{rename } x_0 = \frac{mg}{k} \\
\tag{13}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>And we see we end up with the same second order differential equation as
Equation 4, which yields the same solution <span class="math">\(x(t) = Acos(\frac{k}{m}t + \phi)\)</span>.
We didn't really gain anything by using the Lagrangian but often times in
multiple dimensions, potentially with a different coordinate basis, the
Lagrangian method is easier to use.</p>
</div>
<p>One last note before we move on to the next section.  It turns out the
Euler-Lagrange equation from Equation 9 is agnostic to the coordinate system we are using.
In other words, for another coordinate system <span class="math">\(q_i:= q_i(x_1,\ldots,x_N;t)\)</span>
(with the appropriate inverse mapping <span class="math">\(x_i:= x_i(q_1,\ldots,q_N;t)\)</span>),
the Euler-Lagrange equation still works:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'_m} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_m} &amp;&amp; 1 \leq m \leq N \\
\tag{14}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>From here on out instead of assuming Cartesian coordinates (denoted with
<span class="math">\(x\)</span>'s), we'll be using the generic <span class="math">\(q\)</span> to denote position
with its corresponding first (<span class="math">\(q'\)</span>) and second derivatives (<span class="math">\(q''\)</span>)
for velocity and acceleration, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hamiltonian-and-hamilton-s-equations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11"><span class="sectnum">2.3</span> The Hamiltonian and Hamilton's Equations</a></h3>
<p>We're slowly making our way towards HMC and we're almost there!  Let's discuss
how we can solve the equations of motion using Hamiltonian mechanics.  We first
start off with another esoteric quantity:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
E := \big(\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'_i} q'_i \big) - L \tag{15}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where we have potentially <span class="math">\(N\)</span> particles and/or coordinates.  The symbol
<span class="math">\(E\)</span> is used because <em>usually</em> Equation 15 is the total energy of the
system.  Let's show that in 1D using the fact that
<span class="math">\(L=K-U=\frac{1}{2}mq'^2 - U(q)\)</span> for potential energy <span class="math">\(U(q)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
E &amp;:= \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'} q' - L \\
  &amp;= \frac{\partial (\frac{1}{2}mq'^2 - U(q))}{\partial q'} q' - L \\
  &amp;= mq' \cdot q' - L \\
  &amp;= 2K - (K - U) \\
  &amp;= K + U \\
  \tag{16}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where we can see that it's the kinetic energy <em>plus</em> the potential energy of
the system.  If the coordinate system you are using is Cartesian, then it is
always the total energy.  Otherwise, you have to ensure the change of basis
does not have a time dependence or else there's no guarantee.  See 15.1 from
[2] for more details.</p>
<p>Now we're almost at the Hamiltonian with Equation 15 but we want to do a
variable substitution by getting rid of <span class="math">\(q'\)</span> and replacing it with
something called the <em>generalized momentum</em> (to match our generalized position <span class="math">\(q\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
p := \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'} \tag{17}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is <em>sometimes</em> the same as the usual linear momentum (usually denoted by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>)
you learn about in a first physics class.  Assuming we have the usual equation for kinetic
energy with Cartesian coordinates:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p &amp;:= \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'} \\
  &amp;= \frac{\partial (\frac{1}{2}mq'^2 - U(q))}{\partial q'}
  &amp;= mq'    &amp;&amp; \text{linear momentum}\\
\tag{18}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>However, for example, if you are dealing with angular kinetic energy (such as a
swinging pendulum) and using those coordinates, then you'll end up with
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum">angular momentum</a> instead.
In any case, all we need to know is Equation 17.  Substituting it into our
(often) total energy equation (Equation 15) and re-writing in terms of only
<span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> (no explicit <span class="math">\(q'\)</span>), we get the Hamiltonian:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
H({\bf q, p}) &amp;= \big(\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'_i} q'_i \big) - L  &amp;&amp; \text{definition of } E \\
        &amp;= \big(\sum_{i=1}^N p_i q'_i(q_i, p_i) \big) - L({\bf q, q'(q, p)})  &amp;&amp; p_i := \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'_i}\\
\tag{19}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where I've used bold to indicate vector quantities.  Notice that we didn't
explicitly eliminate <span class="math">\(q'_i\)</span>, we just wrote it as a function of <span class="math">\(q\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math">\(2n\)</span> dimensional coordinates <span class="math">\(({\bf q, p})\)</span> are called the
<em>phase space coordinates</em> (also known as canonical coordinates).  Intuitively,
we can just think of this as the position (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>) and linear momentum
(<span class="math">\(mv = mx'\)</span>), which is what you would expect if you were asked for the
current state of a system (alternatively you could use velocity instead of
momentum).  However, as we'll see later, phase space coordinates have
certain nice properties that we'll utilize when trying to perform MCMC.</p>
<p>Now Equation 19 by itself maybe isn't that interesting, but let's see what happens
when we analyze how it changes with respect to its inputs <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p\)</span>
(in 1D to keep things cleaner).  Starting with <span class="math">\(p\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial H}{\partial p} &amp;= \frac{\partial (p q'(q, p))}{\partial p}  - \frac{\partial L(q, q'(q, p))}{\partial p} \\
                              &amp;= [q'(q, p) + p\frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial p}]
                                 - \frac{\partial L(q, q'(q, p))}{\partial q'} \frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial p} \\
                              &amp;= [q'(q, p) + p\frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial p}]
                                 - p \frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial p} &amp;&amp; p := \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'} \\
                              &amp;= q'(q, p) = q'
                             \tag{20}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Now isn't that nice?  The partial derivative with respect to the generalized
momentum of the Hamiltonian simplifies to the velocity.  Let's see what happens
when we take it with respect to the position <span class="math">\(q\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} &amp;= \frac{\partial (p q'(q, p))}{\partial q}  - \frac{\partial L(q, q'(q, p))}{\partial q} \\
                              &amp;= p\frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q}  -
                                 [\frac{\partial L(q, q')}{\partial q}
                                  + \frac{\partial L(q, q')}{\partial q'} \frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q} ]
                                 &amp;&amp; \text{See remark below} \\
                              &amp;= p\frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q}
                                 - [\frac{d}{dt}\big( \frac{\partial L(q, q')}{\partial q'} \big)
                                  + \frac{\partial L(q, q')}{\partial q'} \frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q} ]
                                 &amp;&amp; \text{Euler-Lagrange equation} \frac{d}{dt}\big(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q'}\big) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} \\
                              &amp;= p\frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q}
                                 - [\frac{dp}{dt} + p \frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q}]
                                 &amp;&amp; p := \frac{\partial L}{\partial q'} \\
                              &amp;= -p'
                             \tag{21}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Similarly, we get a (sort of) symmetrical result where the partial derivative
with respect to the position is the negative first time derivative of the
generalized momentum. Equations 20 and 21 are called <em>Hamilton's equations</em>,
which will allow us to compute the equation of motion as we did in the previous
two methods.  The next example shows this in more detail.</p>

<p>This expression is <em>partially</em> (get it?) confusing because of the notation and partially confusing because
it's not typically seen when discussing the chain rule for partial differentiation.  Notice that the LHS looks
<em>almost</em> identical to the first term in the RHS.  The difference being that
<span class="math">\(q'(q, p)\)</span> is a function of <span class="math">\(q\)</span> on the LHS, while on the RHS it's constant with respect to <span class="math">\(q\)</span>.
To see that, let's re-write the LHS using some dummy functions.</p>
<p>Define <span class="math">\(f(q) = q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(q, p) = q'(q, p)\)</span>, and then substitute into the LHS and apply the
<a class="reference external" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/chainrule.aspx">chain rule for partial differentiation</a>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}

    + \frac{\partial L(q, q')}{\partial q'}\frac{\partial q'(q, p)}{\partial q} \\

</div>
<p>As you can see the first term on the RHS has a "constant" <span class="math">\(q'\)</span> from
the partial differentiation of <span class="math">\(f(q) = q\)</span>.  The notation seems a bit messy,
I did a double take when I first saw it, but hopefully this makes it clear as mud.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-example-3-a-simple-harmonic-oscillator-using-hamiltonian-mechanics">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 3: A Simple Harmonic Oscillator using Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Using the same problem in Example 1 and 2, let's solve it using Hamiltonian
mechanics.  We start by writing the Lagrangian (repeating Equation 12):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
L = K - U = \frac{1}{2}mx'^2 - (-mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Next, calculate the generalized momentum (Equation 17):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p &amp;:= \frac{\partial L}{\partial x'} \\
  &amp;= mx' \\ \tag{23}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Which turns out to just be the linear momentum.  Note, we'll
be using <span class="math">\(x\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\(q\)</span> in this example since
we'll be using standard Cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>From Equation 23, solve for the velocities (<span class="math">\(x'\)</span>) so we can re-write
in terms of momentum, we get:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p &amp;= mx' \\
x' &amp;= \frac{p}{m} \tag{24}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Write down the Hamiltonian (Equation 19) in terms of its phase
space coordinates <span class="math">\((x, p)\)</span>, eliminating all velocities
using Equation 24:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
H({\bf x, p}) &amp;= p x'(x, p) - L({\bf x, x'(x,p)}) \\
              &amp;= p \frac{p}{m} - [\frac{1}{2}mx'^2 - (-mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2)] \\
              &amp;= \frac{p^2}{m} - [\frac{1}{2}m(\frac{p}{m})^2 - (-mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2)] \\
              &amp;= \frac{p^2}{2m} - mgx + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\
\tag{25}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Write down Hamilton's equation (Equation 20 and 21):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} &amp;= -p' \\
-mg + kx &amp;= -p'  \\
\frac{dp}{dt} &amp;= -kx + mg \tag{26} \\
\\
\frac{\partial H}{\partial p} &amp;= x' \\
\frac{p}{m} &amp;= x'  \\
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= \frac{p}{m} \tag{27}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Finally, we just need to solve these differential equations for <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span>.
In general, this involves eliminating <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in favor of <span class="math">\(x'\)</span>.
In this case it's quite simple.  Notice that Equation 26 is exactly
Newton's second law (where <span class="math">\(\frac{dp}{dt} = m\frac{dx'}{dt} = ma\)</span>) and
mirrors Equation 3, while Equation 27 is just the definition of velocity
(where <span class="math">\(p=mv\)</span>).  As a result, we'll end up with exactly the same

Hamilton's equations and then converting it back to where we started.
These are all very good observations and the simple examples shown so far don't
do Hamiltonian mechanics justice.  We usually do not use the
Hamiltonian method for standard mechanics problems involving a small number of
particles.  It really starts to shine when using it for analyses with a large
number of particles (e.g. thermodynamics) or with no particles at all (e.g.
quantum mechanics where everything is a wave function).  We won't get into
these two applications because they are beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>However, another nice thing about the Hamiltonian form is that it has nice some
properties that aren't obvious at first glance.  There are three properties
that we'll care about:</p>
<p><strong>Reversability</strong>: For a particle, given its
initial point in phase space <span class="math">\((q_0, p_0)\)</span> at a point in time, its motion
is completely (and uniquely) determined for all time.  That is, we can use Hamilton's
equations to find its instantaneous rate of change (<span class="math">\((q', p')\)</span>), which
can be used to find its nearby position after a delta of time, and repeated to
find its complete trajectory.  This hints at the application we're going to
use it for: using a numerical method to find its trajectory (next subsection).
Equally important though is the fact that we can reverse this process to find
where it came from.  If you have a path from <span class="math">\((q(t), p(t))\)</span> to
<span class="math">\((q(t+s), p(t+s)\)</span> then you can reverse the operation by negating its time
derivative (<span class="math">\((-q', -p')\)</span>) and move backwards along its trajectory.  This
is because each trajectory is unique in phase space.  We'll use this property
when constructing the Markov chain transitions for HMC.</p>
<p><strong>Conservation of the Hamiltonian</strong>: Another important property is that the
Hamiltonian is conserved.  We can see this by taking the time derivative
of the Hamiltonian (in 1D to keep things simple):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dH}{dt} &amp;= \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}\frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\frac{dp}{dt} \\
 &amp;= -\frac{dp}{dt}\frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{dq}{dt}\frac{dp}{dt} &amp;&amp; \text{Hamilton's equations} \\
 &amp;= 0 \\
 \tag{28}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>This important property lets us <em>almost</em> get to a 100% acceptance rate for HMC.
We'll see later that this ideal is not always maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Volume preservation</strong>: The last important property we'll use it called
Liouville's theorem (from [2]):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liouville's Theorem</strong>: Given a system of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> coordinates <span class="math">\(q_i\)</span>,
the <span class="math">\(2N\)</span> dimensional "volume" enclosed by a given <span class="math">\((2N-1)\)</span>
dimensional "surface" in phase space is conserved (that is, independent of
time) as the surface moves through phase space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll refer to [2] if you want to see the proof.  This is an important result
that will be used to avoid accounting for the change in volume (via Jacobians)
in our HMC algorithm since the multi-dimensional "volume" is preserved.  More
on this later.</p>

<div class="section" id="discretizing-hamiltonian-s-equations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13"><span class="sectnum">2.5</span> Discretizing Hamiltonian's Equations</a></h3>
<p>The simple examples we saw in the last subsections worked out nicely because we
could solve the differential equations for a closed form solution.  As you can
imagine in most cases, we won't have such a nice closed form solution.  Thus,
we turn to approximate methods to compute our desired result (the equations of motion).</p>
<p>One way to approach it is to iteratively simulate Hamilton's equation by
discretizing time using some small <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>.  Starting at time 0,
we can iteratively compute the trajectory in phase space <span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span>
through time using Hamilton's equations.  We'll look at two and a half methods to
accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>Euler's Method</strong>: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler's method</a>
is a technique to solve first order differential equations.  Notice that
Hamilton's equations produce 2N first order differential equations (as opposed
to the Lagrangian, which produces second order differential equations).
Euler's method works by applying a first order Taylor series approximation at
each iteration about the current point.</p>
<p>More precisely, for a given step size <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can approximate the
curve <span class="math">\(y(t)\)</span> given an initial point <span class="math">\(y_0\)</span> and a first order
differential equation using the formula:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
y(t+\epsilon) = y(t) + \epsilon y'(t, y(t))  \tag{29}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(y(t_0)=y_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y'(t, y(t))\)</span> is our first order
differential equation.  This method simply takes small step sizes along the
gradient of our curve where the gradient is computed from our differential
equation using <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and the previous values of <cite>y</cite>.</p>
<p>Translating this to phase space and using Hamilton's equations, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p(t+\epsilon) = p(t) + \epsilon \frac{dp}{dt}(t) = p(t) - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}(q(t)) &amp;&amp; \text{by Hamilton's Equation} \\
q(t+\epsilon) = q(t) + \epsilon \frac{dq}{dt}(t) = q(t) + \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}(p(t)) &amp;&amp; \text{by Hamilton's Equation} \\
\tag{30}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Notice that the equations are dependent on each other, to calculate
<span class="math">\(p(t+\epsilon)\)</span> or <span class="math">\(q(t+\epsilon)\)</span>, we need both <span class="math">\((q(t), p(t))\)</span>.</p>
<p>The main problem with Euler's method is that it quickly diverges from the
actual curve because of the accumulation of errors.  The error propagates
because we assume we start from somewhere on the curve, whereas we're always
some delta away from the curve after the first iteration.  Figure 4 (top left)
shows how the method quickly spirals out of control towards infinity even with
a small epsilon with our simple harmonic oscillator from Examples 1-3
(the black line shows the exact trajectory).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Leapfrog method to approximate Hamiltonian dynamics" src="../../images/hmc_leapfrog.png" style="width: 100%;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 4: Methods to approximate Hamiltonian dynamics: Euler's method, modified Euler's method, and Leapfrog
using the harmonic oscillator from Examples 1-3.</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Modified Euler's Method</strong>: A simple modification to Euler's method is to
update <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> separately.  First update <span class="math">\(p\)</span>,
then use that result to update <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and repeat (the other way around also
works).  More precisely, we get this approximation in phase space:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p(t+\epsilon) &amp;= p(t) + \epsilon \frac{dp}{dt} = p(t) - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}(q(t)) \tag{31}\\
q(t+\epsilon) &amp;= q(t) + \epsilon \frac{dq}{dt} = q(t) + \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}(p(t+\epsilon)) \tag{32}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The results can be seen in Figure 4 (top right) where it much more closely
tracks the underlying curve without tendencies to diverge.</p>
<p>This reason for this is because the pair of equations preserves volume just
like the result from Liouville's theorem above.  Let's show how that is the
case in two dimensions but this result also holds for multiple dimensions. (In
fact, a similar idea used in the following argument can be used to prove
Liouville's theorem.)</p>
<p>First note that Equation 31 can be viewed as a transformation mapping
<span class="math">\((p(t), q(t))\)</span> to <span class="math">\((p(t+\epsilon), q(t))\)</span> (same for Equation 32).
Denote this mapping as <span class="math">\(\bf f\)</span> and let's analyze how the differentials of the
above equation change. Note: I'll change all the parameters to superscripts to
make the notation a bit cleaner. First, we can see the transformation for
Equation 31 as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
p^{t+\epsilon} \\
q^t \\
\end{bmatrix} = {\bf f}\big(
\begin{bmatrix}
p^t \\
q^t \\
\end{bmatrix}\big) \tag{32}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Next, let's calculate the Jacobian of <span class="math">\(\bf f\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
{\bf J_f} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial \bf f}{\partial p^t} &amp; \frac{\partial \bf f}{\partial q^t}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial [p^t - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^t}(q^t)]}{\partial p^t} &amp;
\frac{\partial [p^t - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^t}(q^t)]}{\partial q^t} \\
\frac{\partial q^t}{\partial p^t} &amp;
\frac{\partial q^t}{\partial q^t}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;
-\frac{\partial [\epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^t}(q^t)]}{\partial q^t} \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \\ \tag{33}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>We can clearly see the determinant of the Jacobian is 1.
Next let's see how the infinitesimal volume (or area in this case) changes
using the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables">substitution rule</a>
(this is usually not shown since having a unit Jacobian determinant already implies this):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
dp^{t+\epsilon} dq^t = |det({\bf J_f})| dp^t dq^t = dp^t dq^t \tag{34}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So we see that the volume is preserved when we take an arbitrarily small step
(Equation 31).  We can use the same logic for Equation 32 and thus every
subsequent application of those equations also preserves volume.</p>
<p>Figure 5 shows this visually by drawing a small region near the starting points
and then running Euler's method and modified Euler's method.  For the vanilla
Euler's method, you can see the region growing larger with each iteration. This
has the tendency to cause points to spiral out to infinity (since the area of this region
grows, so do the points that define it).  Modified Euler's doesn't have this problem.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Visualization of volume preservation of modified Euler's method" src="../../images/hmc_vol_preserve.png" style="width: 100%;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5: Contrasting volume preservation nature of the modified Euler's method vs. Euler's method.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>It's not clear to me that volume preservation in general guarantees that it
won't spiral to infinite, nor that non-volume preservation necessarily
guarantees it will spiral to infinite but it does sure seem to help empirically.
The guarantees (if any) are likely related to the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_integrator">symplectic nature</a> of the method but I didn't really look into it much further than that.</p>
<p><strong>Leapfrog Method</strong>: The final method uses the same idea but with an extra <em>Leapfrog</em> step:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p(t+\epsilon/2) = p(t) - \epsilon/2 \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}(q(t)) \tag{35}\\
q(t+\epsilon) = q(t) + \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}(p(t+\epsilon/2)) \tag{36} \\
p(t+\epsilon) = p(t+\epsilon/2) - \epsilon/2 \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}(q(t+\epsilon)) \tag{37}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where we iteratively apply these equations in sequence similar to modified Euler's method.
The idea is that instead of taking a "full step" for <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, we take a "half
step" (Equation 35).  This half step is used to update <span class="math">\(q\)</span> with a full
step (Equation 36), which is then used to update <span class="math">\(p\)</span> using another "half
step" (Equation 37).  The last two subplots (bottom left and right) in Figure 4
show Leapfrog in action, which empirically performs much better than the other methods.</p>
<p>Using the same logic as above, each transform individually is volume
preserving, ensuring similar "nice" behaviour as modified Euler's method.
Notice we're doing slightly more "work" in that we're evaluating Hamilton's
equations an additional time but the trade-off is good in this case.</p>
<p>Another nice property of both modified Euler's and Leapfrog is that it is also
reversible.  Simply negate <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and run the algorithm, then negate
<span class="math">\(p\)</span> to get back where you started.  This works because the momentum is the
only thing causing motion, so negating <span class="math">\(p\)</span> essentially reverses our direction.
Since we're only updating either <span class="math">\(p\)</span> or <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, it allows us to
essentially run the algorithm in reverse.  As you might guess, this
reversibility condition is going to be helpful for use in MCMC.</p>

<div class="section" id="hamiltonian-monte-carlo">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14"><span class="sectnum">3</span> Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a></h2>
<p>Finally we get to the good stuff: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)!
The main idea behind HMC is that we're going to use Hamiltonian dynamics to
simulate moving around our target distribution's density.  The analogy
used in [1] is imagine a puck moving along a frictionless 2D surface <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id2">2</a>.  It
slides up and down hills, losing or gaining velocity (i.e. kinetic energy)
based on the gradient of the hill (i.e. potential energy).  Sound familiar?
This analogy with a physical system is precisely the reason why Hamiltonian
dynamics is such a good fit.</p>
<p>The mapping from the physical situation to our MCMC procedure will be such
that the variables in our target distribution will correspond to the position
(<span class="math">\(q\)</span>), the potential energy will be the negative log probability density
of our target distribution, and the momentum variables (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>) will be
artificially introduced to allow us to sample properly.  So without further
adieu, let's get into the details!</p>
<div class="section" id="from-thermodynamics-to-hmc">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15"><span class="sectnum">3.1</span> From Thermodynamics to HMC</a></h3>
<p>The physical system we're going to base this on is from thermodynamics
(which is only slightly more complex than the mechanical systems we're been
looking at).  A commonly studied situation in thermodynamics is one of
a closed system of fixed volume and number of particles (e.g. gas molecules in
a box) that is "submerged" in a heat bath at thermal equilibrium.
The idea is the heat bath is much, much larger than our internal system so it
can keep it the system at a constant temperature.
Note that even though internal system is at a constant temperature, its energy
will fluctuate because of the mechanical contact with the heat bath, so the
internal system energy is <em>not</em> conserved (i.e., constant). The overall energy
of the combined system (heat bath <em>and</em> internal system) is conserved though.
This setup is called the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_ensemble">canonical ensemble</a>.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental concepts in thermodynamics is the idea of a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)">microstate</a>,
which defines (for classical systems) a single point in phase space.  That is,
the position (<span class="math">\(q\)</span>) and momentum (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>) variables for all particles
defines the microstate of the entire system.
In thermodynamics, we are typically not interested in the detailed movement of
each particle (although will be for MCMC), instead usually want to measure
other macro thermodynamic quantities such as average energy or pressure of the
internal system.</p>
<p>An important quantity we need to compute is the probability of the internal
system being in a particular microstate i.e., a given configuration of
<span class="math">\(p\)</span>'s and <span class="math">\(q\)</span>'s.  Without going into the entire derivation, which
would take us on a larger tangent into thermodynamics, I'll just give the
result, which is known as the Boltzman distribution:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
p_i    &amp;= \frac{1}{Z} e^{\frac{E_i}{kT}} &amp;&amp; \text{general form}\\
P(q, p) &amp;= \frac{1}{Z} e^{\frac{H(q, p)}{kT}} &amp;&amp; \text{Hamiltonian form} \\
       \tag{38}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>  is the probability of being in state <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(q, p)\)</span>
is the same probability but explicitly labelling the state with its phase state coordinates
<span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(E_i\)</span> is the energy state of state <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the
Boltzmann constant, and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is the temperature.  As we know from the previous
section, the total energy of a system is (in this case) equal to the Hamiltonian so
we can easily re-write <span class="math">\(E_i\)</span> as <span class="math">\(H(q, p)\)</span> to get the second form.</p>
<p>It turns out that it doesn't matter how many particles you have in your
internal system, it could be a googolplex or a single particle.  As long as you
have the heat bath and some assumptions about the transfer of heat between the
two systems, the Boltzmann distribution holds.  The most intuitive
way (as an ML person) to interpret Equation 38 is as a "softmax" over all the
microstates, where the energy of the microstate is the "logit" value and
<span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is the normalizing summation over all exponentials.  Importantly, it
is <em>not</em> just an exponentially distributed variable.</p>
<p>In the single particle case, the particle is going to be moving around in your
closed system but randomly interacting with the heat bath, which basically
translates to changing its velocity (or momentum).  This is an important idea
that we're going to use momentarily.</p>

</div>
<p>Figure 6 shows a simple 1 dimensional classical (i.e., non-quantum) system
where a particle is trapped inside a potential well.  The system is
submerged in a heat bath (not-shown) to keep it in thermal equilibrium.
The top diagram shows the momentum vs. position, in other words
it plots the phase space coordinates <span class="math">\((p, x)\)</span>.  The bottom left plot shows
the energy of the system vs. position with the red line indicating the potential
energy at each <span class="math">\(x\)</span> value.  The bottom right plot shows the distribution
of states across energy levels.</p>
<p>A few things to point out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The particle moves along a single axis denoted by the position <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.
So it essentially just moves left and right.</p></li>
<li><p>The velocity (or momentum) changes in two ways: (a) As it moves left and
right, it gains or loses potential energy. This translates into kinetic
energy affecting the velocity (and momentum).  As it approaches an
potential "uphill" its movement along the 1D axis slows in that
direction, similarly when on a potential "downhill" its movement speeds
up along the 1D axis in that direction.
(b) The heat bath will be constantly exchanging energy with the system,
which translates to changing the momentum of the particle.  This happens
randomly as a function of the equilibrium temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>The top phase space plot clearly shows the particle spending most of its
paths (blue) in the dips in the potential function with varying momentum values.
This is as expected because the particle will get "pulled" into the dips
while the momentum could vary by the interaction with the heat bath.</p></li>
<li><p>The bottom left plot shows something similar where the particle is more concentrated
in the dips of the potential function.  Additionally, most of the time
the internal system energy is close to the green dotted line, which represents the average
energy of the particle system.</p></li>
<li><p>The bottom right plot shows the distribution of states by energy.  Note that the
energy states are not a simple exponential distribution as you may think
from Equation 38.  The distribution in Equation 38 is a function of the
microstates <span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span>, <em>not</em> the internal system energy.
This is hidden in the normalization constant <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, which sums over all
microstates to normalize the probabilities to 1.  As a result, the distribution
over energy states can be quite complex as shown.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As we can see from Equation 38 and Example 4, we have related the Hamiltonian
to a probability distribution.  We now (finally!) have everything we need to
setup the HMC method.</p>
<p>This whole digression into thermodynamics is not for naught!  We are in fact
going to use the canonical ensemble to model and sample from our target
distribution.  Here's the setup for target density (or something proportional
to it) <span class="math">\(f({\bf x})\)</span> with <span class="math">\(D\)</span> variables in its support:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Position variables</strong> (<span class="math">\(q\)</span>): The <span class="math">\(D\)</span> variables of our target
distribution (the one we want to sample from) will correspond to our position
variables <span class="math">\(\bf q\)</span>.  Instead of our canonical distribution existing in
(usually) 3 dimensions for a physical system, we'll be using <span class="math">\(D\)</span>
position dimensions for HMC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Momentum variables</strong> (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>): <span class="math">\(D\)</span> corresponding momentum
variables will be introduced artificially in order for the Hamiltonian
dynamics to operate.  They will allow us to simulate both the particle moving
around as well as the random changes in direction that occur when it
interacts with the heat bath.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential energy</strong> (<span class="math">\(U(q)\)</span>): The potential energy will be the
negative logarithm of our target density (up to a normalizing constant):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
U({\bf q}) = -log[f({\bf q})] \tag{39}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kinetic energy</strong> (<span class="math">\(K(p)\)</span>): There can be many choices in how to define
the kinetic energy, but the current practice is to assume that it is independent
of <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, and quadratic in each of the dimensions.  This naturally
translates to a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian (see below) with independent
variances <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>.  This produces the kinetic energy:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
K({\bf p}) = \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i} \tag{40}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hamiltonian</strong> (<span class="math">\(H({\bf q, p})\)</span>): Equation 39 and 40 give us this Hamiltonian:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
H({\bf q, p}) = -log[f({\bf q})] + \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i} \tag{41}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canonical distribution</strong> (<span class="math">\(P({\bf q, p})\)</span>): The canonical ensemble
yields the Boltzmann equation from Equation 38 where we will set <span class="math">\(kT=1\)</span>
and plug in our Hamiltonian from Equation 41:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
P({\bf q, p}) &amp;= \frac{1}{Z}\exp(\frac{H({\bf q, p})}{kT}) &amp;&amp; \text{set } kT=1\\
              &amp;= \frac{1}{Z}\exp(-log[f({\bf q})] + \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i}) \\
              &amp;= \frac{1}{Z_1}\exp(-log[f({\bf q})])\cdot\frac{1}{Z_2}\exp(\sum_{i=1}^D \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i}) \\
              &amp;= P(q)P(p)
\tag{42}
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where <span class="math">\(Z_1, Z_2\)</span> are normalizing constants, and <span class="math">\(P(q), P(p)\)</span> are
independent distributions involving only those variables.  Taking a closer
look at those two distributions, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
P({\bf q}) = \frac{1}{Z_1}\exp(-log[f({\bf q})]) = \frac{1}{Z_1} f({\bf q}) \propto f({\bf q}) \\
P({\bf p}) = \cdot\frac{1}{Z_2}\exp(\sum_{i=1}^D \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i}) \\
\tag{43}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So our canonical distribution is made up of two independent parts: our target distribution
and some zero mean independent Gaussians!  So how does this help us?  Recall
that the canonical distribution models the distribution of microstates
(<span class="math">\(\bf q,p\)</span>). So if we can <em>exactly</em> simulate the
dynamics of the system (via the Hamilton's equations + random interactions with
the heat bath), we would essentially be simulating exactly <span class="math">\(P({\bf q,p})\)</span>, which
leads us directly to simulating <span class="math">\(P({\bf q})\)</span>!</p>
<!-- admonition Why do we need to model the random interactions with the heat bath?

There are two ways to think about this problem.  The first is that if want
to use the Boltzmann distribution, the assumptions only hold either for a
system enclosed in a heat bath *or* if it's a closed system with a very large
number of particles.  Obviously our single particle model only fits into the
former.  If we exclude the heat bath then there is an alternate distribution
specified by the `microcanonical ensemble <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcanonical_ensemble>`__.

Another way to understand it is from the perspective using MCMC to sample
our target distribution.  If we didn't model the random interactions, the
total energy of the system would be fixed (:math:`H(q,p)` is constant).
Therefore, there is a possibility that we would never be able to reach
certain states with a greater energy level, resulting in the procedure not
able to sample parts of the target distribution's support.  Obviously, this
would not lead to a correct sampling procedure. -->
<p>In this hypothetical scenario, we would just need to simulate this system, record
our <span class="math">\(q\)</span> values, and out would pop samples of our target distribution.
Unfortunately, this is not possible.  The main reason is that we cannot <em>exactly</em>
simulate this system because, in general, Hamilton's equations do not yield a
closed form solution.  So we'll have to discretize Hamiltoninan dynamics and add
in a Metropolis-Hastings update step to make sure we're faithfully simulating our
target distribution.  The next subsection describes the HMC algorithm in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hmc-algorithm">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16"><span class="sectnum">3.2</span> HMC Algorithm</a></h3>
<p>The core part of the HMC algorithm follows essentially the same structure as
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm: propose a new sample, accept with some
probability.  The difference is that Hamiltonian dynamics are used to find a
new proposal sample, and the acceptance criteria is simplified because of a
symmetric proposal distribution.
Here's a run-down of the major steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Draw a new value of <span class="math">\(p\)</span> from our zero mean Gaussian.  This simulates
a random interaction with the heat bath.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting in state <span class="math">\((q,p)\)</span>, run Hamiltonian dynamics for <span class="math">\(L\)</span> steps
with step size <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> using the Leapfrog method presented in
Section 2.5.  <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> are hyperparameters of the
algorithm.  This simulates the particle moving without interactions with the heat bath.</p></li>
<li><p>After running <span class="math">\(L\)</span> steps, negate the momentum variables, giving a proposed
state of <span class="math">\((q^*, p^*)\)</span>.  The negation makes the proposal distribution
symmetric i.e. if we run <span class="math">\(L\)</span> steps again, we get back to the original
state.  The negation is necessary for our MCMC proof below but the
negation is unimportant because we always square the momentum before using
it in the Hamiltonian.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The proposed state <span class="math">\((q^*, p^*)\)</span> is accepted as the next state using a
Metropolis-Hastings update with probability:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
A(q^*, p^*) &amp;= \min\big[1, \frac{f(q^*, p^*)g(q, p | q^*, p^*)}{f(q, p)g(q^*, p^* | q, p)}\big] \\
              &amp;= \min\big[1, \frac{f(q^*, p^*)}{f(q, p)}\big] &amp;&amp; \text{symmetry of proposal distribution} \\
              &amp;= \min[1, \frac{\exp(-H(q^*, p^*))}{\exp(-H(q,p))}] \\
              &amp;= \min[1, \exp(-U(q^*) + U(q) -K(p^*)+K(p))] \\
              \tag{44}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>If the next state is not accepted (i.e. rejected), then the current state
becomes the next state.  This MH step is needed to offset the approximation
of our discretized Hamiltonian.  If we could exactly simulate Hamiltonian
dynamics this acceptance probability would be exactly <span class="math">\(1\)</span> because the
Hamiltonian is conserved (i.e. constant).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's all relatively straight forward (assuming you have the requisite
background knowledge above).  It generally converges faster than
a random walk-based MH algorithm, but it does have some key assumptions.
First, we can only sample from continuous distributions on
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{R}^D\)</span> because otherwise our Hamiltonian dynamics could not
operate.  Second, similar to MH, we need to be able to evaluate the density
up to a normalizing constant.  Finally, we must be able to compute the partial
derivative of the log density in order to compute Hamilton's equations.  Thus,
these derivatives must exist everywhere the density is non-zero.
There are several other detailed assumptions you can look up in [1] if you are
interested.</p>
<p>What's nice is that all that math reduces down to quite a simple algorithm.
Listing 1 shows pseudo-code for one iteration of the algorithm, which is pretty
straightforward to implement (see the experiments section where I implement a toy
version of HMC).</p>

the two half momentum steps from Equation 35 and 37.  A bit of the magic is
hidden behind the potential and gradient of the potential function but those
depend fully on your target distribution so it can't be helped.</p>
<p>It's not obvious that the above algorithm would be correct, particularly the
acceptance step, which we simply stated without much reasoning.  We'll examine
its correctness the next subsection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hmc-algorithm-correctness">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17"><span class="sectnum">3.3</span> HMC Algorithm Correctness</a></h3>
<p>To show that HMC correctly produces samples, we will show that the algorithm
correctly samples from the <em>joint</em> canonical ensemble distribution <span class="math">\(P(q, p)\)</span>.
Since we already identified that this joint distribution can be factored into independent
distributions <span class="math">\(P(q)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P(p)\)</span> (Equation 42), our final output
can just take the <span class="math">\(q\)</span> samples to get our desired result.</p>
<p>We ultimately want to show that the next state returned in Listing 1
occurs with the correct probability according to the canonical distribution.
First, we'll look at the very first operation: sampling of the momentum (Line 11 from Listing 1).
Assume that you have sampled <span class="math">\(q\)</span> properly (up to this point) according to
our canonical distribution (the input to Listing 1).  Since our momentum factor
is independent, we can simply sample the momentum from its correct distribution
(an independent normal distribution) and the resulting sample <span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span>
will distributed according to the canonical ensemble as required.</p>
<p>Next, we'll look at the rest of the algorithm, which runs Leapfrog for L steps
and does an MH update (Line 15-41).  We'll only be sketching the idea here and
will not go into too many formalities.  To start, let's divide up phase space
(<span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span>) into arbitrarily small partitions.  Since these are
arbitrarily small regions, the probability density, Hamiltonian and other
associated quantities are constant within those region.  The idea is that these
finite regions can be shrunk down to infinitesimally small sizes that we would
need to prove the general result.  Additionally, this is where the
volume-preserving nature of the Leapfrog algorithm comes in (and negation of
the momentum, which is also volume-preserving).  We don't need to worry about
our small regions ever growing (or shrinking) and thus, we can treat any region
(before or after a Leapfrog step) similarly.</p>
<p>Assume you have sampled the current state <span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span> according to the
canonical distribution i.e., <span class="math">\((q, p)\)</span> after you sample the momentum.
The probability that the next state is in some (infinitesimally) small region
<span class="math">\(X_k\)</span> is the sum of probabilities that it's (a) already in <span class="math">\(X_k\)</span> and it gets rejected
(<code>else</code> statement in Listing 1) <em>plus</em> (b) the probability that it's in some other state
and moves into state <span class="math">\(X_k\)</span>.  Given canonical distribution probability state
<span class="math">\(P(X_k)\)</span>, rejection probability <span class="math">\(R(X_k)\)</span>, and
transition probability <span class="math">\(T(X_k|X_i)\)</span> from region <span class="math">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math">\(k\)</span>,
we can see that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
P(\text{ending up in state } X_k)
  &amp;= P(X_k)R(X_k) + \sum_i P(X_i)T(X_k|X_i) &amp;&amp; \text{Assume current state sampled correctly} \\
  &amp;= P(X_k)R(X_k) + \sum_i P(X_k)T(X_i|X_k) &amp;&amp; \text{Detailed balance condition} \\
  &amp;= P(X_k)R(X_k) + P(X_k) \sum_i T(X_i|X_k)  \\
  &amp;= P(X_k)R(X_k) + P(X_k) (1 - R(X_k))  \\
  &amp;= P(X_k) \\
\tag{45}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Thus, we see that our procedure will have correctly sampled our next
state <span class="math">\(X_k\)</span> according to the target distribution.  From the second line,
detailed balance (aka reversibility) is one of the key properties
that we must have for this to work properly.  The other thing to notice is that
the probability of <em>leaving</em> state <span class="math">\(X_k\)</span> to <em>any given</em> state is
precisely the probability of <em>not</em> rejecting.  So if we satisfy detailed
balance (and the Markov chain has a steady state), we will have shown that
we correctly sampled from the canonical distribution.</p>
<p>Now we will show the three conditions needed for a Markov chain described in
the background to show that it does converge to a steady state and has the
detailed balance condition.  First, our procedure trivially can reach any state
due to
the normally distributed momentums, which span the real line, thus it is
<em>irreducible</em> (practically though it is critically important to tune the variance
on the normal distributions due to finite runs).  Second, we need to
ensure that the system never returns to the same state with a fixed period
(i.e., it is aperiodic).  Theoretically, this may be possible in certain setups but can be
avoided by randomly choosing <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> or <span class="math">\(L\)</span> within a narrow
interval.  Practically though, this is pretty rare on any non-trivial problem,
although this may lead to other problems like very slow to converge.</p>
<p>Lastly, all that is left to show is that detailed balance is satisfied.
Assume we start our Leapfrog operation in state <span class="math">\(X_k\)</span> and run it for
<span class="math">\(L\)</span> steps plus reverse the momentum, and end in state <span class="math">\(Y_k\)</span>.
We need to show detailed balance holds for all <span class="math">\(i,j\)</span> such that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
P(X_i)T(Y_j|X_i) = P(Y_j)T(X_i|Y_j) \tag{46}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Let's break it down into two cases:</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong> <span class="math">\(i \neq j\)</span>: Recall that the Leapfrog algorithm is deterministic,
therefore <span class="math">\(Y_i = \text{Leapfrog_Plus_Reverse}(X_i)\)</span> for any given <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.  So if you
have any other <span class="math">\(Y_{j\neq i}\)</span> then it is impossible to transition to this state.
Thus, <span class="math">\(T(X_i|y_j) = 0\)</span> and Equation 46 is trivially satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong> <span class="math">\(i = j\)</span>: In this case, let's plug in our transition/acceptance probability
condition (Equation 44) and see what happens.  Note that in addition to the probability
being constant within a region, we also have the Hamiltonian constant too.  Let <span class="math">\(V\)</span> be the
volume of the region, <span class="math">\(H_{X_k}, H_{Y_k}\)</span> be the value of the Hamiltonian
in each region, and without loss of generality assume
<span class="math">\(H_{X_k} &gt; H_{Y_k}\)</span> (due to symmetry of the problem). Plugging this all into Equation 46,
we see that it satisfies the detailed balance condition:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
LHS &amp;= P(X_i)T(Y_j|X_i) \\
    &amp;= \frac{V\cdot\exp(-H_{X_k})\min{(1, \exp(-H_{Y_k}+H_{X_k}))}}{Z} \\
    &amp;= \frac{V\cdot\exp(-H_{X_k})(1)}{Z} &amp;&amp; \text{assumption } H_{X_k} &gt; H_{Y_k} \\
    &amp;= \frac{V\cdot\exp(-H_{X_k})}{Z} \\
    \tag{47} \\
RHS &amp;= P(Y_j)T(X_i|Y_j) \\
    &amp;= \frac{V\cdot\exp(-H_{Y_k})\min{(1, \exp(-H_{X_k}+H_{Y_k}))}}{Z} \\
    &amp;= \frac{V\cdot\exp(-H_{Y_k})\exp(-H_{X_k}+H_{Y_k})}{Z} &amp;&amp; \text{assumption } H_{X_k} &gt; H_{Y_k} \\
    &amp;= \frac{V\cdot\exp(-H_{X_k})}{Z} \\
    \tag{48}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where the probability of being in state <span class="math">\(P(X_i)\)</span> is the volume of the
region (<span class="math">\(V\)</span>) multiplied by the density (Boltzman distribution).  This works
because of our infinitesimally small regions where we assume the density is
constant throughout.</p>
<p>Two subtle points to mention.
First, if we were able to simulate Hamiltonian dynamics exactly, <span class="math">\(H_{X_k} = H_{Y_k}\)</span>
(recall the Hamiltonian is constant along a trajectory), then that would get us to
a 100% acceptance rate.  Unfortunately, Leapfrog or any other approximation method
doesn't quite get us there so we need the MH step.  Second, the reason why we
need to negate the momentum at the end is so that our transition probabilities
are symmetric, i.e.  <span class="math">\(T(X_k|Y_k) = T(Y_k|X_k)\)</span> (Equation 44), which
follows from the fact that we can reverse our Leapfrog steps by negating the momentum
and running it back the same number of steps.  If we didn't include this step,
then we would have to include another adjustment factor (<span class="math">\(g(y|x) / g(x|y)\)</span>),
which comes from the more generic MH step described in Equation 1.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18"><span class="sectnum">3.4</span> Additional Notes</a></h3>
<p>It should be pretty obvious that the explanation above only presents the core
math behind HMC.  To make it practically work, there are a lot more details.
Here are just a few of the issues that make a real world implementation complex
(for all these points, [1] has some additional discussion if you want more detail):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tuning step size (<span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) and number of steps (<span class="math">\(L\)</span>) is so critically important
that it can make or break your HMC implementation (see discussion in
the experiments below).  You can get into all sorts of incorrect sampling
behaviors if you get it wrong from highly correlated samples to low
acceptance rates.  You have to be very careful!</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, tuning the momentum hyperparameters (the standard deviation for
our independent Gaussians in our case) is also very important to getting proper samples.
If your momentum is too low, then you won't be able to explore the tails of your distribution.
If your momentum is too high, then you'll have a very low acceptance rate.
To add to the complexity, the momentum distribution is related to the step size
and number of steps too.  In general, it's best if you can tune each dimension
of the momentum distribution to fit your problem but that is typically non-trivial.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, you'll have a mix of discrete and continuous variables.  In those cases,
you can mix and match MCMC methods and use HMC only for a subset of
continuous variables.  Similarly, there are adaptations of HMC to continuous
variables that don't span the real line.</p></li>
<li><p>A practical technique to use HMC was the discovery of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo#No_U-Turn_Sampler">No U-Turn Sampler</a>
(NUTS).  Roughly, the algorithm adaptively sets the path length by running
Leapfrog both backwards and forwards in time, and then seeing where the
trajectory "changes direction" (a "U-Turn").  At this point, you randomly
sample a point from your path.  In this way, you likely have seen enough of
the local landscape to not double back on your path (which wastes
computation) but still have enough momentum to reach the tails.  As far as I
can tell, most implementations of HMC will have a NUTS sampler.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="experiments">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19"><span class="sectnum">4</span> Experiments</a></h2>
<p>As usual, I implemented a toy version of HMC to better understand how it works.
You can take a look at the code on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bjlkeng/sandbox/blob/master/hmc/hmc.ipynb">Github</a>
(note: I didn't spend much time cleaning up the code).  It's a pretty simple implementation
of HMC and MH MCMC algorithms, which pretty much mirrors the pseudocode above.</p>
<p>I ran it for two very simple examples.  The first is a standard normal
distribution, where you can see the run summary in Figure 7.  The two left and
two right panels show the HMC and MH results, respectively.  Both methods use
a standard normal distribution for the momentum distribution and the proposal
distribution, respectively.  I show the histogram of 1000 samples (overlaid
with the actual density) with its associated autocorrelation plot.  You can see
that the HMC algorithm has a higher acceptance rate (97% vs. 70%), which
results in fewer steps needed to sample.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Histogram of samples from toy implementation of HMC and MH for a standard normal distribution" src="../../images/hmc_experiment1.png" style="width: 100%;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 7: Histogram of samples from toy implementation of HMC and MH for a standard normal distribution</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Overall the samples look more or less reasonable.  This is backed up by the
autocorrelation (AC) plots, which shows little to no correlation between
samples (i.e. independence).  I had to (manually) tune both algorithms in order
to get to a point where the AC plots didn't show significant correlation.  For
MH, I had to increase the step size sufficiently.  For HMC, I had to tune
between the step size and number of steps to get that result.</p>
<p>Adding another dimension, I also ran HMC and MH for a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Bivariate_case">bivariate normal distribution</a>
with standard deviation in both dimension of <span class="math">\(1.0\)</span>, and a correlation of <span class="math">\(0.9\)</span>
for 1000 samples.
The samples are plotted (from left to right, top to bottom) in Figure 8 for two
HMC runs, a MH run, and directly sampling from the distribution (via Numpy).  I
plotted the unit circle to give a sense of scale of the
standard deviation of two dimensions (multivariate normal distributions with
non-diagonal covariance matrices don't typically look spherical though).
I also tuned all of them (except for Numpy) to have a relatively
low autocorrelation plot.  In the plot titles, "Acc" stands for acceptance rate,
"eps" is epsilon, "st" is steps, "pstd" is standard deviation for momentum
normal distribution (same for both dimensions), "prop" is proposal distribution
(same standard deviation for both dimensions).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Histogram of samples from toy implementation of HMC, MH, and Numpy for a bivariate normal distribution" src="../../images/hmc_experiment2.png" style="width: 100%;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 8: Histogram of samples from toy implementation of HMC, MH, and Numpy for a bivariate normal distribution</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Looking at the top left HMC samples and the bottom right Numpy direct sampling,
we can see they are visually very similar.  This is a good case of being able
to generate reasonable samples.  I ran another HMC example but with a
smaller standard deviation (top right), and you can see all the samples are
concentrated in the middle.  This shows that setting the momentum properly is
critical for generating proper samples.  In this case, we see that the
distribution doesn't have enough "energy" to reach far away points so we never
sample from there (for this particular finite run).</p>
<p>Turning to the MH sampler, visually it also looks relatively similar to the
Numpy samples. Similar to HMC, I had to set the standard deviation of the
proposal distribution (independent Gaussians) to a relatively large value.  If
not, then it would be extremely unlikely to reach distant points (unless you
had many more steps).  The large random jumps result in a very low acceptance
rate, which means we need more proposal jumps to get independent samples.</p>
<p>I considered doing a more complex example such as a Bayesian linear regression
or hierarchical model, but after all the fiddling with the two simple examples
above, I thought it wasn't worth it.  I'll leave the MCMC implementations to
the pros. I'm already quite satisfied with the understanding that I've gained
going through this exercise (not to mention my newfound appreciation for its
complexity) .</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20"><span class="sectnum">5</span> Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>It's really rewarding to finally understand (to a satisfactory degree) a topic
that you thought was "too difficult" just a few years ago.  I originally wasn't
looking to do a post on HMC but went down this rabbit hole trying to understand
another topic that slightly overlaps with it.  This is part of the joy of being
able to independently study things, too bad time is so limited.  In any case, I'm
hoping to <em>eventually</em> get back to the topic that I was originally interested
in at some point, and hopefully be able to find time to post more often.  In
the meantime, stay safe and have a happy holidays!</p>

<p>This physical analogy is not exactly accurate because gravity, which affects the velocity of the puck, doesn't quite match our target density.  Instead, a better analogy would be a particle moving around in a vector field (e.g. an electron moving around in an electric field defined by our target density).  Although more accurate, it's less intuitive than a puck sliding along a surface so I get why the other analogy is better.</p>
