<p>In this post, I'm going to be describing a really cool idea about how
to improve variational autoencoders using inverse autoregressive
flows.  The main idea is that we can generate more powerful posterior
distributions compared to a more basic isotropic Gaussian by applying a
series of invertible transformations.  This, in theory, will allow
your variational autoencoder to fit better by concentrating the
stochastic samples around a closer approximation to the true
posterior.  The math works out so nicely while the results are kind of
marginal <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>.  As usual, I'll go through some intuition, some math,
and have an implementation with few experiments I ran.  Enjoy!</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p><br></p>
<h4> Motivation </h4>
<p>Recall in vanilla variational autoencoders (<a class="reference external" href="../variational-autoencoders">previous post</a>), we have the generative
network ("the decoder"), the posterior network ("the encoder"), which
are related to each other through a set of diagonal Gaussian variables
usually labelled <span class="math">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In most cases, our primary objective is to train the decoder i.e. the
generative model.  The structure of the decoder is shown in Figure 1.
We have our latent diagonal Gaussian variables, followed by a
deterministic high-capacity model (i.e. deep net), which then outputs
the parameters for our output variables (e.g. Bernoulli's if we're
modelling black and which pixels).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt='Variational "Decoder" Diagram' src="../../images/variational_autoencoder4.png" style="height: 300px;"><p class="caption">Figure 1: The generative model component of a variational autoencoder</p>
</div>
<p>The main problem here is that training this generative model is pretty
difficult.  The brute force way is to make an input/output dataset by
taking each output you have (e.g. images) and cross it with a ton of
random samples from <span class="math">\(z\)</span>.  If <span class="math">\(z\)</span> has many dimensions, then
to properly cover the space you'll need an exponential number of
examples.  For example, if your number of dimensions is <span class="math">\(D=1\)</span>,
you might need to sample roughly <span class="math">\((10)^1=10\)</span> points per image,
making your dataset 10x.  If <span class="math">\(D=10\)</span>, you'll probably need
<span class="math">\((10)^{10}\)</span> points per image, making your dataset too big to
practically train.  Not only that, most the sampled points will not contribute
much to training your network because they'll be in parts of the latent space
that are very low probability (with respect to the current image), contributing
almost nothing to your network weights.</p>
<p>Of course that's exactly why variational autoencoders are so
brilliant.  Instead of randomly sampling from your <span class="math">\(z\)</span> space,
we'll use "directed" sampling to a pick point <span class="math">\(z\)</span> using our encoder (or
posterior) network such that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is much more likely to occur.
This allows you to efficiently train your generator network.  The cool thing is
that we are actually training both networks simultaneously!  To actually
accomplish this though, we have to use fully factorized diagonal Gaussian
variables and a "reparameterization trick" in order to properly get the thing
to actually work (see my <a class="reference external" href="../variational-autoencoders">previous post</a>
for details).  The structure is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Variational Autoencoder Diagram" src="../../images/autoencoder_reparam_trick.png" style="height: 300px;"><p class="caption">Figure 2: Left: A naive implementation of an autoencoder without the
reparameterization trick.  Right: A vanilla variational autoencoder with the
"reparameterization trick" (Source: [4])</p>
</div>
<p>As you can imagine, the posterior network is an estimate of the true
posterior (as is the case for variational inference methods).
Unfortunately our fully factorized diagonal Gaussians can't model every
distribution.  In particular, the fact that they're fully factorized can
limit the ability to match the true posterior we're trying to model.
Theoretically if we are able to more closely approximate the true
posterior, our generator network should be able to train more easily,
and thus improve our overall result.</p>
<p>The question is how can we use a more complex distribution?  The
reason we're stuck with factorized Gaussians is because it is
(a) computationally efficient to compute and differentiate the
posterior (just backprop through the <span class="math">\(z\)</span> mean and variance), and (b) it's
easy to sample at every minibatch (which is just sampling from independent
Gaussians because of the reparameterization trick).  If we want to replace it
we're going to need to still maintain these two desirable properties.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Normalizing Flows for Variational Inference </h4>
<p>Normalizing flows in the context of variational inference was
introduced by Rezende et al. in [1].  At its core, it's just applying an
invertible transformation (i.e.
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function#Dependent_variables_and_change_of_variables">a change of variables</a>)
to our fully factorized posterior distribution to make it into
something more flexible that can match the true posterior.
It's called a normalizing flow because the density "flows" through
each transform.  See the box below about transforming probability
density functions.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-transforming-probability-density-functions">
<p class="first admonition-title">Transforming Probability Density Functions</p>
<p>Given a n-dimensional random variable <span class="math">\(\bf x\)</span> with joint
density function <span class="math">\(f({\bf x})\)</span>, we can transform it into
another n-dimensional random variable <span class="math">\(\bf y\)</span> via an
invertible (i.e. 1-to-1) and differentiable function <span class="math">\(H\)</span>
with joint density <span class="math">\(g({\bf y})\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\bf y} = H({\bf x}) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It turns out the joint density <span class="math">\(g({\bf y})\)</span> can be computed
as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
g({\bf y}) &amp;= f({\bf x})\big|\text{det}(\frac{d{\bf x}}{d{\bf y}})\big| \\
           &amp;= f(H^{-1}({\bf y}))\big|\text{det}(\frac{d{H^{-1}({\bf y})}}{d{\bf y}})\big|
\tag{2}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where the latter part of each line contains a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant#Jacobian_determinant">determinant of a Jacobian</a>.
In the last line we're making it explicit that the density is a
function <span class="math">\(\bf y\)</span>.  Alternatively, we can also write this in
terms of <span class="math">\({\bf x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
g({\bf y}) &amp;= f({\bf x})\big|\text{det}(\frac{d{\bf x}}{d{\bf y}})\big| \\
           &amp;= f({\bf x})\big|\text{det}(\big[\frac{dH({\bf x})}{d{\bf x}}\big]^{-1})\big| \\
           &amp;= f({\bf x})\big|\text{det}(\frac{dH({\bf x})}{d{\bf x}})\big|^{-1}
           \tag{3}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>It's a bit confusing because of all the variable changing but keep
in mind that you can change between <span class="math">\({\bf x}\)</span> with <span class="math">\({\bf y}\)</span> without
much trouble because there is a 1-1 mapping.
So starting from the original statement, we first apply the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_theorem">inverse function theorem</a>,
which allows us to re-write the Jacobian matrix in terms of
<span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\({\bf x}\)</span>.  Next, we apply a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Multiplicativity_and_matrix_groups">property</a>
of determinants which says the determinant of an inverse of a
matrix is just the reciprocal of the determinant of the original
matrix.</p>
<p class="last">It's a bit strange why we would want to put things back in terms
of <span class="math">\({\bf x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H\)</span> but sometimes (like in this post)
we want to evaluate <span class="math">\(g({\bf y})\)</span> but don't want to
explicitly compute <span class="math">\(H^{-1}\)</span>. Instead, it's easier to just
work with <span class="math">\(H\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's see some math to make this idea a bit more precise.
Start off with a simple posterior for our initial variable, call it
<span class="math">\(\bf z_0\)</span>.  In vanilla VAEs we use a fully factorized Gaussian
e.g.  <span class="math">\(q({\bf z_0}|{\bf x}) \sim \mathcal{N}({\bf \mu(x)}, {\bf \sigma(x)})\)</span>.
Next, we'll want to apply a series of invertible transforms
<span class="math">\(f_t(\cdot)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
{\bf z_0} &amp;\sim q({\bf z_0}|{\bf x}) \\
{\bf z_t} &amp;\sim f_t({\bf z_{t-1}}, {\bf x}) &amp; \forall t=1..T
\tag {4}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Remember our posterior distribution (i.e. our encoder) is conditioned
on <span class="math">\({\bf x}\)</span>, so we can freely use it as part of our transformation here.
Using Equation 3, we can compute the (log) density of the final variable
<span class="math">\({\bf z_t}\)</span> as such:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\log q({\bf z_T} | {\bf x}) = \log q({\bf z_0}|{\bf x})
- \sum_{t=1}^T \log \big| \text{det}(\frac{d{\bf z_t}}{d{\bf z_{t-1}}}) \big|
  \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Equation 5 is simply just a repeated application of Equation 3,
noticing that since we're in log space the reciprocal of the
determinant turns into a negative sign.</p>
<p>So why does this help at all?  The normalizing flow can be thought of
as a sequence of expansions or contractions on the initial density,
allowing for things such as multi-modal distributions (something we
can't do with a basic Gaussian).  Additionally, it allows us to have
complex relationships between the variables instead of the
independence we assume with our diagonal Gaussians.
The trick then is to pick a transformation <span class="math">\(f_t\)</span> that
gives us the flexibility, but more importantly is easy to compute
because we want to use this in a VAE setup.  The next section
describes an elegant and simple to compute transform that accomplishes
both of these things.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Inverse Autoregressive Transformations </h4>
<p>An autoregressive transform is one where given a sequence of variables
<span class="math">\({\bf y} = \{y_i \}_{i=0}^D\)</span>, each variable is dependent only on the
previously indexed variables i.e. <span class="math">\(y_i = f_i(y_{0:i-1})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Autoregressive autoencoders introduced in [2]
(and my <a class="reference external" href="../autoregressive-autoencoders">post on it</a>)
take advantage of this property by constructing an extension of a vanilla
(non-variational) autoencoder that can estimate distributions (whereas the regular one doesn't
have a direct probabilistic interpretation).  The paper introduced the idea in
terms of binary Bernoulli variables, but we can also formulate it in terms of
Gaussians too.</p>
<p>Recall that Bernoulli variables only have a single parameter <span class="math">\(p\)</span> to
estimate, but for a Gaussian we'll need two functions to estimate the mean and
variance denoted by <span class="math">\([{\bf \mu}({\bf y}), {\bf \sigma}({\bf y})]\)</span>.
However, due to the autoregressive property, the individual elements are only
functions of the prior indices and thus their derivatives are zero with respect
to latter indices:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\mu_i &amp;= f_i(y_{0:i-1})\\
\sigma_i &amp;= g_i(y_{0:i-1}) \\
\frac{\partial[\mu_i, \sigma_i]}{\partial y_j} &amp;= [0, 0] &amp;\text{ for } j\geq i \\
\tag{6}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Given <span class="math">\([{\bf \mu}({\bf y}), {\bf \sigma}({\bf y})]\)</span>, we can
sequentially apply an autoregressive transform on a noise vector
<span class="math">\(\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, {\bf I})\)</span> as such:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
y_0 &amp;= \mu_0 + \sigma_0 \odot \epsilon_0. \\
y_i &amp;= \mu_i({\bf y_{0:i-1}}) + \sigma_i({\bf y_{0:i-1}}) \odot \epsilon_i &amp; \text{ for } i &gt; 0
\tag{7}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where addition is element-wise and <span class="math">\(\odot\)</span> is element-wise multiplication.
Intuitively, this is a natural way to make Gaussians, you multiply by some
standard deviation and add some mean.</p>
<p>However in our case, we can transform any vector, not just a noise vector.
This is shown on the left hand side of Figure 3 where we take a <span class="math">\(\bf x\)</span>
vector and transform it to a <span class="math">\(\bf y\)</span> vector.  You'll notice that we have
to perform <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}(D)\)</span> sequential computations, thus making it too slow for our
intended purpose of use in a normalizing flow.  But what about the inverse
transform?</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Autoregressive Transform" src="../../images/iaf.png" style="width: 550px;"><p class="caption">Figure 3: Gaussian version of Autoregressive Transform and Inverse
Autoregressive Transforms</p>
</div>
<p>The inverse transform can actually be parallelized (we'll switch to <span class="math">\(\bf x\)</span> as
the input variable instead of <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) as shown in Equation 8 and
the right hand side of Figure 3 so long as we have <span class="math">\(\sigma_i &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x_i = \frac{y_i - \mu_i({\bf y_{0:i-1}})}{\sigma_i({\bf y_{0:i-1}})} \tag{8}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where subtraction and division is element-wise.</p>
<p>Now here comes the beauty of this transform.  Recall in normalizing flows
to properly compute the probability, we have to be able to compute
the determinant (or log-determinant).  However, Equation 6 shows that
<span class="math">\(\bf \mu, \sigma\)</span> have no dependence on the current or latter variables
in our sequence.  Thus from Equation 8, the Jacobian is lower triangular with a
simple diagonal:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d{\bf x}}{d{\bf y}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sigma_0} &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
\frac{\partial x_0}{\partial y_1} &amp; \frac{1}{\sigma_1} &amp; \dots  &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial x_0}{\partial y_D} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial x_{D-1}}{\partial y_D} &amp;  \frac{1}{\sigma_D} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{9}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Knowing that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its
diagonals, this gives us our final result for the log determinant which
is incredibly simple to compute:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\log \big| det \frac{d{\bf x}}{d{\bf y}} \big|
= - \sum_{i=0}^D \log \sigma_i({\bf y}_{0:i-1}) \tag{10}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In the next section, we'll see how to use this inverse autoregressive transform
to build a more flexible posterior distribution for our variational
autoencoder.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Inverse Autoregressive Flows </h4>
<p>Adding an inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) to a variational autoencoder is as
simple as (a) adding a bunch of IAF transforms after the latent variables
<span class="math">\(z\)</span> (b) modifying the likelihood to account for the IAF transforms.</p>
<p>Figure 4 from [3] shows a depiction of adding several IAF transforms to a
variational encoder.
Two things to note: (1) a context <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is additionally generated, and
(2) the IAF step only involves multiplication and addition, not division and
subtraction like in Equation 8.  I'll explain these two points as we work
through the math below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Autoregressive Transform" src="../../images/iaf2.png"><p class="caption">Figure 4: (Left) An Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) transforming the basic
posterior of an variational encoder to a more complex posterior through
multiple IAF transforms. (Right) A single IAF transform. (Source: [3])</p>
</div>
<p>To start off, we generate our basic latent variables as we would in an
vanilla VAE starting from a standard diagonal Gaussian
<span class="math">\({\bf \epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\bf z}_0 = {\bf \mu}_0 + {\bf \sigma}_0\odot {\bf \epsilon} \tag{11}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\({\bf \mu}_0, {\bf \sigma}_0\)</span> are generated by our encoder network.
So far nothing too exciting.</p>
<p>Now here's the interesting part, we want to apply Equation 8 as an IAF transform
to go from <span class="math">\({\bf z}_t\)</span> to <span class="math">\({\bf z}_{t+1}\)</span> (indices refer to the
number of transforms applied on the vector <span class="math">\(\bf z\)</span>, not the index into
<span class="math">\(\bf z\)</span>) but there are a few issues we need to resolve first.  Let's start
with reinterpreting Equation 8, rewriting it in terms of <span class="math">\({\bf z}_t\)</span> and
<span class="math">\({\bf z}_{t+1}\)</span> (we'll omit the indices into the vector with the
understanding that <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> are autoregressive):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
{\bf z}_{t+1}
    &amp;= \frac{{\bf z}_t - {\bf \mu}_t({\bf z}_t)}{{\bf \sigma}_t({\bf z}_t)} \\
    &amp;= \frac{{\bf z}_t}{{\bf \sigma}_t({\bf z}_t)} -
       \frac{{\bf \mu}_t({\bf z}_t)}{{\bf \sigma}_t({\bf z}_t)} \\
    &amp;= {\bf z}_t \odot {\bf s}_t({\bf z}_t) +
       {\bf m}_t({\bf z}_t) \\
\tag{12}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\({\bf s}_t = \frac{1}{{\bf \sigma}_t}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\({\bf m}_t = -\frac{{\bf \mu}_t}{{\bf \sigma}_t}\)</span>.  We can do this re-writing
because remember that we are learning these functions through a neural network
so it doesn't really matter if we invert or negate.</p>
<p>Next, let's introduce a context <span class="math">\(\bf h\)</span>.  Recall, our posterior is
<span class="math">\(p({\bf z}|{\bf x})\)</span> but this is the same as just saying
<span class="math">\(p({\bf z}|{\bf x}, f({\bf x}))\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> is some
deterministic function.  So let's just define <span class="math">\({\bf h}:=f({\bf x})\)</span>
and then use it in our IAF transforms.  This is not a problem because our
latent variable is still only a function of <span class="math">\({\bf x}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
{\bf z}_{t+1}
    &amp;= {\bf z}_t \odot {\bf s}_t({\bf z}_t, {\bf h}) + {\bf m}_t({\bf z}_t, {\bf h}) \\
\tag{13}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Equation 13 now matches Figure 4 (where we've relabelled <span class="math">\(\mu, \sigma\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(m, s\)</span> for clarity).</p>
<p>The last thing to note is that in the actual implementation, [3] suggests
a modification to improve numerical stability while fitting.
Given the outputs of the autoregressive network:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
[{\bf m}_t, {\bf s}_t] = \text{AutoregressiveNN}[t]({\bf z}_t, {\bf h}; {\bf \theta})
\tag{14}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We construct <span class="math">\({\bf z}_t\)</span> as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\bf z}_t = \text{sigm}({\bf s}_t)\odot {\bf z}_{t-1} + (1 - \text{sigm}({\bf s}_t))\odot {\bf m}_t
\tag{15}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where sigm is the sigmoid function.  This is inspired by an LSTM-style
updating.  They also suggest to initialize the weights of <span class="math">\({\bf s}_t\)</span> to
saturate the sigmoid so that it's mostly just a pass-through to start.
During experimentation, I saw that if I didn't use this LSTM-style trick, by the
third or fourth IAF transform I started getting NaNs really quickly.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> Deriving the IAF Density </h5>
<p>Now that we have Equation 15, we can finally derive the posterior density.
Even with the change of variable above, <span class="math">\({\bf s}, {\bf m}\)</span>  are still autoregressive
so Equation 10 applies.  Using this fact, starting from Equation 5:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\log q({\bf z_T} | {\bf x}) &amp;= \log q({\bf z_0}|{\bf x})
- \sum_{t=1}^T \log \big| det(\frac{d{\bf z_t}}{d{\bf z_{t-1}}}) \big| \\
&amp;= \log q({\bf z_0}|{\bf x}) - \sum_{t=1}^T \big[- \sum_{i=0}^D \log {\bf \sigma}_{t, i}\big] &amp; \text{Equation 10} \\
&amp;= \log q({\bf z_0}|{\bf x}) - \sum_{t=1}^T \big[\sum_{i=0}^D \log {\bf s}_{t, i}\big] &amp; \text{Change variable to }{\bf s} \\
&amp;= - \sum_{i=0}^D \big[ \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_i^2 + \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi) + \sum_{t=0}^T \log {\bf s}_{t, i}\big]  \\
  \tag{16}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(q({\bf z}_0|{\bf x})\)</span> is just an isotropic Gaussian centered at
<span class="math">\({\bf \mu}_0\)</span> with <span class="math">\({\bf \sigma}_0\)</span>.  Here we apply Equation 3
to transform back to an expression involving just <span class="math">\(\bf \epsilon\)</span>, and
absorb the <span class="math">\({\sigma}_0\)</span> into the summation (by changing variable to
<span class="math">\({\bf s}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we can write our entire variational objective as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\log{p({\bf x})} &amp;\geq -E_q\big[\log\frac{q({\bf z}_T|{\bf x})}{p({\bf z}_T,{\bf x})}\big]  \\
           &amp;= E_q\big[\log p({\bf z}_T,{\bf x}) - \log q({\bf z}_T|{\bf x})\big] \\
           &amp;= E_q\big[\log p({\bf x}|{\bf z}_T) + \log p({\bf z}_T) - \log q({\bf z}_T|{\bf x})\big] \\
  \log q({\bf z_T} | {\bf x})
  &amp;= - \sum_{i=0}^D \big[ \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_i^2 + \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi) + \sum_{t=0}^D \log {\bf s}_{t, i}\big]  \\
  \log p({\bf z_T}) &amp;= - \sum_{i=0}^D \big[ \frac{1}{2}{\bf z}_T^2 + \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi)\big]  \\
  \tag{17}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(\log p({\bf z_T})\)</span> as our standard diagonal Gaussian prior and whatever
distribution you want on your output variable <span class="math">\(\log p({\bf x}|{\bf z}_T)\)</span>
(e.g. Bernoulli, Gaussian, etc.).
With Equation 17, you can just negate it and use it as your loss function for
your IAF VAE (the expectation gets estimated implicitly with the mini-batches
of your stochastic gradient descent).</p>

<h4> Experiments: IAF Implementation </h4>
<p>I implemented a VAE with IAF on both a binarized MNIST dataset as well as CIFAR10
in a set of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bjlkeng/sandbox/tree/master/notebooks/vae-inverse_autoregressive_flows">notebooks</a>.
My implementation uses a modification of the MADE autoencoder from [2] (see my previous post on <a class="reference external" href="../autoregressive-autoencoders">Autoregressive Autoencoders</a>)
for the IAF layers.  I only used the "basic" version of the IAF network from
the paper, not the extension based on ResNet.
As usual, things were pretty easy to put together using Keras because I
basically took the code for a VAEs, added the code I had for a MADE, and
modified the loss function as needed <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The network for the encoder consists of a few convolution layers, a couple of dense
layers, and a symmetric structure for the decoder except with transposed
convolutions.  I used 32 latent dimensions for MNIST and 128 for CIFAR10 with
proportional number of filters and hidden nodes for the convolutional and dense
layers respectively.  For the IAF portion, I used separate MADE layers (with 2
hidden layers each) for the <span class="math">\(\bf m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bf s\)</span> variables with 10x
hidden nodes relative to the latent dimensions.  As the paper suggested, I
reversed the order of <span class="math">\(\bf z_t\)</span> after each IAF transform.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows the results of the experiments on both datasets.  As you can see
the IAF layers seems to do a bit of improvement on MNIST taking the validation
loss down from <span class="math">\(72.3\)</span> to <span class="math">\(70.9\)</span>, while there's barely an
improvement on the test output loss.  This didn't really have any affect on the
generated images, which qualitatively showed no difference.  The IAF layers
seemed improve the MNIST numbers a bit but only marginally.</p>
<p>The CIFAR10 results seemed to get worse on validation/test sets.  One thing
that I did notice is that adding more IAF layers requires more training
(there are many more parameters) and also you need some "tricks" in order
to properly train it.  This is likely due to the long chain of dense layers
that make up the IAF transforms, similar to troubles you might have in an LSTM.
So it's quite possible that the IAF layers could be slightly beneficial but
I just didn't train it quite right.</p>
<p>My overall conclusion is that IAF didn't seem to have a huge affect on the
resulting output (at least on its own).  I was hoping that it would help VAEs
achieve GAN-like results but alas, it's not quite there.  I will note that [3]
actually had a novel architecture using IAF transforms with a ResNet like
structure.  This is where they achieved near state-of-the-art results on
CIFAR10.  Probably this structure is much easier to train (like ResNet) and
really allows you to take advantage of the IAF layers.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> Implementation Notes </h5>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The "context" vector is connected to the input of the MADE with an additional dense layer (see implementation).</li>
<li>The trick from Equation 15 was needed.  Even at 4 IAF layers I started getting NaNs pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Even beyond Equation 15, I had a lot of trouble with getting things to be
stable with the MADE computations, not sure if all of them helped:<ul>
<li>Added regularizers on the MADE layers.</li>
<li>Used 'sigmoid' for activation for all MADE stuff (instead of the 'elu' activation I used for the other layers).</li>
<li>I disabled dropout for all layers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I had a bunch of confusion with the <span class="math">\(\log q(z|x)\)</span> computation, especially
the determinant.  Only after I worked through the math did I actually figure
out the sign of the determinant in Equation 17.  The key is really understanding
the change of variables in Equation 12.</li>
<li>I actually spent a lot of time trying to get IAFs to work on a "toy" example
using various synthetic data like mixed Gaussians or weird auto-regressive
distributions.  In all these cases, I had a lot of trouble showing that the
IAF transforms did anything, it looks to perform pretty much on par with a
vanilla VAE.  My hypothesis on this is that either the distributions were too
simple so the vanilla VAE works really well, or the IAF transforms don't do
much.  I suspect the latter is probably most of it.</li>
<li>Now I'm wondering if the normalizing flow transforms from [1] will do a better job
but I didn't spend any time trying to implement it to see if it made a difference.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Conclusion </h4>
<p>Well there you have, another autoencoder post!  When I first read about this idea
I was super excited because conceptually it's so beautiful!  Using the exact same
VAE that we all know and love, you can improve its performance just by transforming
the posterior and removing the big perceived limitation: diagonal Gaussians.
Unfortunately, normalizing flows with IAF transforms are no silver bullet and the
improvements I saw were pretty small (if you know otherwise please let me know!).
Despite this, I still really like the idea, at least theoretically, because I think
it really shows some creativity to use the <em>inverse</em> of an autoregressive flow
in addition to the whole concept of a normalizing flow.  Who knew transforming
probability distributions would be useful?  Anyways, I learned lots of really
interesting things working on this and you can expect more in the new year!
Happy Holidays!</p>
