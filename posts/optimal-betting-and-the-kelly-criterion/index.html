<p>My last post was about some <a class="reference external" href="../gamblers-fallacy-and-the-law-of-small-numbers">common mistakes</a> when betting
or gambling, even with a basic understanding of probability.  This post is going to
talk about the other side: optimal betting strategies using some very
interesting results from some very famous mathematicians in the 50s and 60s.
I'll spend a bit of time introducing some new concepts (at least to me), setting up the
problem and digging into some of the math.  We'll be looking at it from the
lens of our simplest probability problem: the coin flip.  A note: I will not be
covering the part that shows you how to make a fortune -- that's an exercise
best left to the reader.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p><br></p>
<h4> Background </h4>
<p></p>
<h5> History </h5>
<p>There is an incredibly fascinating history surrounding the
mathematics of gambling and optimal betting strategies.  The optimal
betting strategy, more commonly known as the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>, was developed in the 50s by
<a class="reference external" href="http://home.williampoundstone.net/Kelly.htm">J. L. Kelly</a> , a scientist
working at Bell Labs on data compression schemes at the time.  In 1956, he made
an ingenious connection between his colleague's (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Shannon</a>) work on information theory,
gambling, and a television game show publishing his new findings in a paper
titled <em>A New Interpretation of Information Rate</em> (whose original title was
<em>Information Theory and Gambling</em>).</p>
<p>The paper remained unnoticed until the 1960s when an MIT student named Ed Thorp
told Shannon about his card-counting scheme to beat blackjack.  Kelly's paper
was referred to him, and Thorp started using it to amass a small fortune using
Kelly's optimal betting strategy along with his card-counting system.  Thorp
and his colleagues later went on to use the Kelly Criterion in other
varied gambling applications such as horse racing, sports betting, and even the
stock market.  Thorp's hedge fund outperformed many of his peers and it was
this success that made Wall Street take notice of the Kelly Criterion.  There is a
great book called Fortune's Formula <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id1">[1]</a> that details the stories and
adventures surrounding these brilliant minds.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> Surely, Almost Surely </h5>
<p>In probability theory, there are two terms that distinguish very similar
conditions: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely#.22Almost_sure.22_versus_.22sure.22">"sure" and "almost sure"</a>.
If an event is <strong>sure</strong>, then it always happens.  That is, it is not possible for
any other outcome to occur.  If an event is <strong>almost sure</strong> then it occurs with
probability 1.  That is, theoretically there <em>might</em> be an outcome not belonging to
this event that can occur, but the probability is so small that it's smaller
than any fixed positive probability, and therefore must be 0.  This is kind of
abstract, so let's take a look at an example (from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Imagine we have a unit square where we're randomly throwing point-sized darts that
will land inside the square with a uniform distribution.  For the entire square
(light blue), it's easy to see that it makes up the entire sample space, so we would
say that the dart will <em>surely</em> land within the unit square because there is no
other possible outcome.</p>
<img alt="unit square" class="align-center" src="../../images/unit_square.png" style="height: 350px;"><p>Further, the probability of landing in any given region is the ratio of its
area to the ratio of the total unit square, simplifying to just the area of a
given region.  For example, taking the top left corner (dark blue), which
is 0.5 units x 0.5 units, we could conclude that <span class="math">\(P(\text{dart lands in
dark blue region}) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now here's the interesting part, notice that there is a small red dot in the
upper left corner.  Imagine this is just a single point at the upper left
corner on this unit square.  What is the probability that the dart lands on the
red dot?  Since the red dot has an area of <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(\text{dart lands
on red dot}) = 0\)</span>.  So we could say that the dart <em>almost surely</em> does not land
on the red dot.  That is, theoretically it could, but the probability of doing
so is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.  The same argument can be made for <em>every</em> point in the square.</p>
<p>The dart actually does land on a single point of the square though, so even
though the probability of landing on that point is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, it still does
occur.  For these situations, it's not <em>sure</em> that we won't hit that specific
point but it's <em>almost sure</em>.  A subtle difference but quite important one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Optimal Betting <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id2">[2]</a> </h4>
<p></p>
<h5> Optimal Betting with Coin Tossing </h5>
<p>Imagine playing a game with an infinite wealthy opponent who will always take
an even bet made on repeated independent tosses of a biased coin.
Further, let the probability of winning be <span class="math">\(p &gt; \frac{1}{2}\)</span> and
losing be <span class="math">\(q = 1 - p\)</span> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id3">[3]</a>, so we have a positive overall expected value
for the game <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id4">[4]</a>.  You start with <span class="math">\(X_0\)</span> of initial
capital.  Question: <em>How much should we bet each time?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>
<strong>Example 1</strong>:</dt>
<dd>This can be made a bit more concrete by putting some numbers to it.
Let's say our coin lands on heads with a chance of <span class="math">\(p=0.53\)</span>,
which means tails must be <span class="math">\(q=1-p=0.47\)</span>.  Our initial bankroll is
<span class="math">\(X_0=$100,000\)</span>.  How much of this <span class="math">\($100,000\)</span> should we bet on the first
play?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's formalize the problem using some mathematics.  Denote our remaining capital
after the <em>k</em>'th toss as <span class="math">\(X_k\)</span> and on the <em>k</em>'th toss we can bet <span class="math">\(0
\leq B_k \leq X_{k-1}\)</span>.  Let's use a variable <span class="math">\(T_k = 1\)</span> if the
<em>k</em>'th trial is a win, and <span class="math">\(T_k=-1\)</span> for a loss.  Then for the <em>n</em>'th toss, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
X_n &amp;= X_{n-1} + T_nB_n  \\
    &amp;= X_{n-2} + T_{n-1}B_{n-1} + T_nB_n \\
    &amp;= \ldots \\
    &amp;= X_0 + \Sigma_{k=1}^{n} T_kB_k \tag{1}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>One possible strategy we could use is to maximize the expected value of
<span class="math">\(X_n\)</span>.  Let's take a look at that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
E(X_n) &amp;= E(X_0 + \Sigma_{k=1}^{k} T_kB_k)  \\
       &amp;= X_0 + \Sigma_{k=1}^{k} E(B_kT_k) \\
       &amp;= X_0 + \Sigma_{k=1}^{k} (p - q) E(B_k) \tag{2}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(p - q &gt; 0\)</span> this will have a positive expected payoff.  To maximize
<span class="math">\(E(X_n)\)</span>, we should maximize <span class="math">\(E(B_k)\)</span> (this is the only variable we
can play with), which translates to betting our <em>entire bankroll</em> at each toss.
For example, on the first toss bet <span class="math">\(B_0 = X_0\)</span>, on the second toss (if we won
the first one) bet <span class="math">\(B_1 = 2X_0\)</span> and so on.  It doesn't take a
mathematician to know that is not a good strategy. Why?  The probability of
ruin is almost sure (ruin occurs when <span class="math">\(X_k = 0\)</span> on the <em>k</em>'th toss).</p>
<p>If we're betting our entire bankroll, then we only need one loss to lose all
our money.  The probability of ruin is then <span class="math">\(1 - p^n\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n\)</span> tosses (every
outcome <em>except</em> winning on every toss).  Taking the limit as <span class="math">\(n\)</span> approaches infinity:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (1 - p^n) = 1 \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So we can see that this aggressive strategy is almost surely <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id5">[5]</a> going to result in ruin.</p>
<p>Another strategy might be to try and minimize ruin.  You can probably already intuit
that this strategy involves making the <em>minimum</em> bet.  From Equation 2, this is
not desirable because it will also minimize our expected return.  This suggests that we
want a strategy that is in between the minimum bet and betting everything (duh!).
The result is the Kelly Criterion.</p>
<p></p>
<h5> The Kelly Criterion </h5>
<p>Since our maximum bet is limited by our current bankroll, it seems plausible that
the optimal strategy will always bet relative to our current bankroll. To
simplify the math, we assume that the money is infinitely divisible.  However,
it should be noted that this limitation doesn't really matter too much when our
capital is relatively large compared to the minimum divisible unit (think
millions vs. cents).</p>
<p>If on every toss, we bet a fraction of our bankroll (known as "fixed fraction"
betting), <span class="math">\(B_k = fX_{k-1}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(0 \leq f \leq 1\)</span>, we can
derive an equation for our bankroll after <span class="math">\(S\)</span> successes and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> failures
in <span class="math">\(S+F=n\)</span> trials:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
X_n = X_0(1+f)^S(1-f)^F \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that we can't technically ever get to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> but practically there is a minimum
bet and if we go below it, we are basically ruined.  We can just re-interpret
ruin in this manner.  That is, ruin for a certain strategy is when we will
almost surely go below some small positive integer <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> as the
number of trials <span class="math">\(n\)</span> grows i.e., <span class="math">\(lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}P(X_n
\leq \epsilon) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let's setup what we're trying to maximize.
We saw that trying to maximize the expected return leads us to almost surely
ruin.  Instead, Kelly chose to maximize the expected exponential growth rate.
Let's see what that means by first looking at the ratio of current bankroll to
our starting bankroll:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{X_n}{X_0} &amp;= e^{\log(\frac{X_n}{X_0})} \\
                &amp;= e^{n \log(\frac{X_n}{X_0})^{1/n}} \\
                &amp;= e^{n G(f)} \tag{5}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So <span class="math">\(G(f)\)</span> represents the exponent (base <span class="math">\(e\)</span>) on how fast our
bankroll is growing.  Substituting Equation 4 into <span class="math">\(G(f)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
G(f) &amp;= \log(\frac{X_n}{X_0})^{1/n} \\
     &amp;= \log((1+f)^S(1-f)^F)^{1/n} \\
     &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\log((1+f)^S(1-f)^F) \\
     &amp;= \frac{S}{n}\log(1+f) + \frac{F}{n}\log(1-f) \tag{6}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Now since <span class="math">\(G(f)\)</span> is a random variable, we want to maximize the expected
value of it (which we denote as <span class="math">\(g(f)\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
g(f) &amp;= E[G(f)] \\
     &amp;= E[\frac{S}{n}\log(1+f) + \frac{F}{n}\log(1-f)] \\
     &amp;= E[\frac{S}{n}]\log(1+f) + E[\frac{F}{n}]\log(1-f) \\
     &amp;= p\log(1+f) + q\log(1-f) \tag{7}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The last line simplifies because the expected proportion of successes and
failures is just their probabilities <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id6">[6]</a>.  Now all we have to do is a simple
exercise in calculus to find the optimal value <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> that maximizes <span class="math">\(g(f)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
g'(f) = \frac{p}{1+f} + \frac{q}{1-f} &amp;= 0 \\
        \frac{p-pf+q+qf}{(1+f)(1-f)}  &amp;= 0 \\
        \frac{1-(p-q)f}{(1+f)(1-f)}  &amp;= 0  &amp;&amp; \text{since } p+q=1\\
        1 - (p-q)f &amp;= 1 - f^2 \\
        f^2 - (p-q)f &amp;= 0 \\
        f = f^* &amp;= p - q &amp;&amp; \text{since } f&gt;0  \tag{8}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So we now have our optimal betting criterion (for even bets), fractional bets
with <span class="math">\(f^*=p-q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another interesting behavior of varying our fractional bets can be gleaned by
graphing <span class="math">\(G(f)\)</span> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id7">[7]</a>:</p>
<img alt="G(f)" class="align-center" src="../../images/g_of_f.png" style="height: 450px;"><p>We can see that our <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> maximizes the growth rate.  However, there is a point
<span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> where our growth rate becomes negative.  This implies that if we
over-bet <span class="math">\(f &gt; f_c\)</span>, we will almost surely reach ruin (because we have a
negative growth rate).  The following (summarized) theorem from Thorp's paper
states this more precisely:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Theorem 1</strong></dt>
<dd><ol class="first last lowerroman simple">
<li>If <span class="math">\(g(f) &gt; 0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}X_n = \infty\)</span> almost surely.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(g(f) &lt; 0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}X_n = 0\)</span> almost surely.</li>
<li>Given a strategy <span class="math">\(\Theta^*\)</span> and any other "essentially different strategy" <span class="math">\(\Theta\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{X_n(\Theta^*)}{X_n(\Theta)} = \infty\)</span> almost surely.</li>
</ol></dd>
</dl>
<p>From this theorem, we can see that if we pick a fraction such that <span class="math">\(g(f)
&gt; 0\)</span>, then we'll almost surely tend towards an increasing bankroll.
Conversely, if we pick a fraction <span class="math">\(g(f)&lt;0\)</span>, then we will almost surely
result in ruin.  This matches up with our intuition that over-betting is
counter-productive.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Example 2:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">(Continued from Example 1)
Suppose we have our even-bet coin toss game and the probability of heads is
<span class="math">\(p=0.53\)</span> and probability of tails is <span class="math">\(q=0.47\)</span>.  Our initial
bankroll is <span class="math">\($100,000\)</span> (big enough that the minimum bet isn't really
significant).  Applying our optimal betting criteria, on our first play
we should bet <span class="math">\(f=p-q=0.53-0.47=0.06\)</span> or <span class="math">\(6\%\)</span> of our bankroll, translating to
<span class="math">\($100,000 * 6\% = $6,000\)</span>.  Assuming we win the first play, we should bet
<span class="math">\($106,000 * 6\% = $6,360\)</span> and so on.</p>
<p>If we bet less than <span class="math">\(6\%\)</span>, we will still be increasing our bankroll but not at
the optimal rate.  We can also bet more than <span class="math">\(6\%\)</span> up to the theoretical point <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span>
such that <span class="math">\(g(f_c)=0\)</span> with the same result.
We can numerically determine this turning point, which in this case is
<span class="math">\(f_c \approx 0.11973\)</span>.  So betting more than roughly 11.9% will almost
surely cause us ruin.</p>
<p>We can also compute the expected exponential growth rate using our optimal
<span class="math">\(f^*=  0.06\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
g(f^*) = g(0.06) &amp;= E[p\log(1+f) + q\log(1-f)]  \\
                 &amp;= 0.53\log(1+0.06) + 0.47\log(1-0.06)]  \\
                 &amp;\approx 0.001801 \tag{9}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="last">So after <span class="math">\(n\)</span> plays, a player can expect his bankroll to be
<span class="math">\(e^{0.001801n}\)</span> times larger.  A doubling time can be computed
by setting <span class="math">\(e^{0.001801n}=2\)</span>, resulting in <span class="math">\(n\approx 385\)</span> plays.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p></p>
<h5> Betting with Uneven Payoffs and Other Variations </h5>
<p>We've so far only looked at games with even payoffs.  We can generalize this result.
If for each unit wagered, you can win <span class="math">\(b\)</span> units, we can derive a modified version
of Equation 7:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
g(f) = E[log(\frac{X_n}{X_0}) = p\log(1 +bf) + q\log(1-f) \tag{10}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving for the optimum yields <span class="math">\(f^*=\frac{bp-q}{b}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another variation is when you can make multiple simultaneous bets such as when
multiple players share a single bankroll.  Going through a similar exercise, we
can derive values for <span class="math">\(f_1^*, f_2^*, \ldots\)</span> assuming the games played
are independent.  When two players are playing the same game (e.g. same table
for Blackjack), the bets are correlated and adjustments must be made.
Additionally, we can analyze more complex situations such as continuous (or
nearly continuous) outcomes like the stock market which require a more thorough
analysis using more complex math.  See Thorp's paper for more details.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4> Conclusion </h4>
<p>Kelly's optimal betting criterion is an incredibly interesting mathematical
result.  However, perhaps what is more interesting is that this theoretical result
was put into practice by some of the very mathematicians that worked on it!
Thorp has had wild success applying it in various situations such as
sports betting, Blackjack and the stock market.  Of course by itself the
criterion isn't much use, it is only once you've found a game that has a
positive expected value that you can put it to use.  I would go into how to do
that but I think I've written enough for one day and as I said, it's best left
as an exercise to the reader.</p>
