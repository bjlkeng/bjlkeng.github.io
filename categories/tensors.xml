topics that I've been writing about recently and go back to some basics: math!
In particular, tensors.  This is a topic that is casually mentioned in machine
learning papers but for those of us who weren't physics or math majors
(*cough* computer engineers), it's a bit murky trying to understand what's going on.
So on my most recent vacation, I started reading a variety of sources on the
interweb trying to piece together a picture of what tensors were all
about.  As usual, I'll skip the heavy formalities (partly because I probably
couldn't do them justice) and instead try to explain the intuition using my
usual approach of examples and more basic maths.  I'll sprinkle in a bunch of
examples and also try to relate it back to ML where possible.  Hope you like
it!&lt;/p&gt;
