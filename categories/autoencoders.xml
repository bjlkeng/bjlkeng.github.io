This post is kind of a digression (which seems
to happen a lot) along my journey of learning more about probabilistic
generative models.  There's so much in ML that you can't help learning a lot
of random things along the way.  That's why it's interesting, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's topic is &lt;em&gt;importance sampling&lt;/em&gt;.  It's a really old idea that you may
have learned in a statistics class (I didn't) but somehow is useful in deep learning,
what's old is new right?  How this is relevant to the discussion is that when
we have a large latent variable model (e.g. a variational
autoencoder), we want to be able to efficiently estimate the marginal likelihood
given data.  The marginal likelihood is kind of taken for granted in the
experiments of some VAE papers when comparing different models.  I was curious
how it was actually computed and it took me down this rabbit hole.  Turns out
it's actually pretty interesting!  As usual, I'll have a mix of background
material, examples, math and code to build some intuition around this topic.
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

(aka learn more about) a very popular neural network architecture called
Residual Networks aka ResNet.  This architecture is being very widely used
because it's so simple yet so powerful at the same time.  The architecture's
performance is due its ability to add hundreds of layers (talk about deep
learning!) without degrading performance or adding difficulty to training.  I
really like these types of robust advances where it doesn't require fiddling
with all sorts of hyper-parameters to make it work.  Anyways, I'll introduce
the idea and show an implementation of ResNet on a few runs of a variational
autoencoder that I put together on the CIFAR10 dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

to improve variational autoencoders using inverse autoregressive
flows.  The main idea is that we can generate more powerful posterior
distributions compared to a more basic isotropic Gaussian by applying a
series of invertible transformations.  This, in theory, will allow
your variational autoencoder to fit better by concentrating the
stochastic samples around a closer approximation to the true
posterior.  The math works out so nicely while the results are kind of
marginal &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/variational-autoencoders-with-inverse-autoregressive-flows/#id3" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.  As usual, I'll go through some intuition, some math,
and have an implementation with few experiments I ran.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

find them extremely interesting!  In this post, I'm going to be explaining
a cute little idea that I came across in the paper &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03509.pdf"&gt;MADE: Masked Autoencoder
for Distribution Estimation&lt;/a&gt;.
Traditional autoencoders are great because they can perform unsupervised
learning by mapping an input to a latent representation.  However, one
drawback is that they don't have a solid probabilistic basis
(of course there are other variants of autoencoders that do, see previous posts
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/variational-autoencoders/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/a-variational-autoencoder-on-the-svnh-dataset/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/semi-supervised-learning-with-variational-autoencoders/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
By using what the authors define as the &lt;em&gt;autoregressive property&lt;/em&gt;, we can
transform the traditional autoencoder approach into a fully probabilistic model
with very little modification! As usual, I'll provide some intuition, math and
an implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

exploration
(previous posts: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/variational-autoencoders/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/a-variational-autoencoder-on-the-svnh-dataset/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) by
writing about how to use variational autoencoders to do semi-supervised
learning.  In particular, I'll be explaining the technique used in
"Semi-supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models" by Kingma et al.
I'll be digging into the math (hopefully being more explicit than the paper),
giving a bit more background on the variational lower bound, as well as
my usual attempt at giving some more intuition.
I've also put some notebooks on Github that compare the VAE methods
with others such as PCA, CNNs, and pre-trained models.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

autoencoder (VAE) on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/"&gt;Street View House Numbers&lt;/a&gt;
(SVHN) dataset.  My last post on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/variational-autoencoders/"&gt;variational autoencoders&lt;/a&gt;
showed a simple example on the MNIST dataset but because it was so simple I
thought I might have missed some of the subtler points of VAEs -- boy was I
right!  The fact that I'm not really a computer vision guy nor a deep learning
guy didn't help either.  Through this exercise, I picked up some of the basics
in the "craft" of computer vision/deep learning area; there are a lot of subtle
points that are easy to gloss over if you're just reading someone else's
tutorial.  I'll share with you some of the details in the math (that I
initially got wrong) and also some of the implementation notes along with a
notebook that I used to train the VAE.  Please check out my previous post
on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/variational-autoencoders/"&gt;variational autoencoders&lt;/a&gt; to
get some background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2017-08-09: I actually found a bug in my original code where I was
only using a small subset of the data!  I fixed it up in the notebooks and
I've added some inline comments below to say what I've changed.  For the most
part, things have stayed the same but the generated images are a bit blurry
because the dataset isn't so easy anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

learning method in machine learning called variational autoencoders.  It's main
claim to fame is in building generative models of complex distributions like
handwritten digits, faces, and image segments among others.  The really cool
thing about this topic is that it has firm roots in probability but uses a
function approximator (i.e.  neural networks) to approximate an otherwise
intractable problem.  As usual, I'll try to start with some background and
motivation, include a healthy does of math, and along the way try to convey
some of the intuition of why it works.  I've also annotated a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bjlkeng/sandbox/blob/master/notebooks/variational-autoencoder.ipynb"&gt;basic example&lt;/a&gt;
so you can see how the math relates to an actual implementation.  I based much
of this post on Carl Doersch's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;,
which has a great explanation on this whole topic, so make sure you check that
out too.&lt;/p&gt;
