For a long time I've resisted making
a blog about anything technical because, to be frank, I didn't feel like I
was qualified.  What makes me more qualified now?  Nothing really, I'm just a bit less
afraid of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/386/"&gt;being wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe a good place to start is what I used to setup this blog and what the
domain/title mean.
For my personal blog (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.briankeng.com/"&gt;www.briankeng.com&lt;/a&gt;), where
I discuss random worldly wisdom that I come across, I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.
For this one, I used something a bit more technical (because why not?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great place to host a static website (free) but also has some of that "hacker
cred".  It's quite easy to use (if you've used git before) and also quite
well &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;
on how to get your domain setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; (static site generator)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended static site generator with Github Pages is Jekyll but one
thing I wanted for this site is to make use of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html"&gt;IPython Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;.  After a bit of searching, I found
Nikola to be a good match because it supports IPython Notebooks out of the box
(as opposed to Jekyll which required some fiddling), and seemd to have a reasonably
simple setup.  The really interesting line from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#getting-more-themes"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;
is this quote: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;DON'T READ THIS MANUAL. IF YOU NEED TO READ IT I FAILED, JUST USE THE THING.&lt;/code&gt;
Exactly the sentiment I was going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://themes.getnikola.com/#bootstrap3"&gt;Bootstrap3&lt;/a&gt; theme and &lt;a class="reference external" href="bhttp://bootswatch.com/readable/"&gt;Readable&lt;/a&gt; Bootstrap theme.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap3 is the default theme for Nikola, conveniently using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;,
the most popular HTML/CSS/JS framework for the web.  Since I'm not a very
good designer using high quality themes/framework is definitely ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default Nikola theme, however, was not too my liking.  A bit too spartan for me.  Fortunately, Nikola has a really cool
feature where you can take an existing Bootstrap theme from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bootswatch.com"&gt;http://bootswatch.com&lt;/a&gt;
and skin the default Nikola Bootstrap theme.  I chose the &lt;a class="reference external" href="bhttp://bootswatch.com/readable/"&gt;Readable&lt;/a&gt; theme because I'm
a huge fan of making things easy-to-read (you should see how large the font
size is on my devices, frequently referred to as "old people font size").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the new Bootstrap theme, the site layout didn't quite look right.
So I fiddled around with the layout and placement of items, pretty much
copying the layout of another blog I really enjoy &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/"&gt;programming in the twenty-first century&lt;/a&gt; by James Hague.
It was interesting playing around with HTML templates and CSS but pretty much
confirmed that it's not really what I like doing.  Getting to a satisfactory
layout was as much effort as I really wanted to put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
