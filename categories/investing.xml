I
do have another post that is more topic appropriate but it's been pretty hectic
so I haven't had time to finish it.  Although, investing is definitely a kind of
technical topic involving data and numbers, so one could argue it is still on
topic.  And argue I shall!  Enjoy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of smart people I meet frequently mention that they have no clue about
investing or other related financial matters.  They're quite right that modern
finance can get complicated really fast such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model"&gt;option pricing models&lt;/a&gt; (that require
differential equations and other such complicated maths) but as in most things
though, a little common sense goes a long way.  So I want to share an analogy
that I think will help people understand a rational way to invest &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; value
investing.  In particular, the discussion will be geared towards investing in
publicly traded stocks but the general idea applies to most asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;
