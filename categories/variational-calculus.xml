the most common one, the mean-field approximation.  This is a topic that I've
been trying to understand for a while now but didn't quite have all the background
that I needed.  After picking up the main ideas from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/the-calculus-of-variations"&gt;variational calculus&lt;/a&gt; and
getting more fluent in manipulating probability statements like
in my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/the-expectation-maximization-algorithm"&gt;EM&lt;/a&gt; post,
this variational Bayes stuff seems a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variational Bayesian methods are a set of techniques to approximate posterior
distributions in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"&gt;Bayesian Inference&lt;/a&gt;.
If this sounds a bit terse, keep reading!  I hope to provide some intuition
so that the big ideas are easy to understand (which they are), but of course we
can't do that well unless we have a healthy dose of mathematics.  For some of the
background concepts, I'll try to refer you to good sources (including my own),
which I find is the main blocker to understanding this subject (admittedly, the
math can sometimes be a bit cryptic too).  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

variational calculus.
Analogous to the usual methods of calculus that we learn in university,
this one deals with functions &lt;em&gt;of functions&lt;/em&gt; and how to
minimize or maximize them.  It's used extensively in physics problems such as
finding the minimum energy path a particle takes under certain conditions.  As
you can also imagine, it's also used in machine learning/statistics where you
want to find a density that optimizes an objective &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://satisficing.briankeng.com/posts/the-calculus-of-variations/#id4" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.  The explanation I'm
going to use (at least for the first part) is heavily based upon Svetitsky's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://julian.tau.ac.il/bqs/functionals/functionals.html"&gt;Notes on Functionals&lt;/a&gt;, which so far is
the most intuitive explanation I've read.  I'll try to follow Svetitsky's
notes to give some intuition on how we arrive at variational calculus from
regular calculus with a bunch of examples along the way.  Eventually we'll
get to an application that relates back to probability.  I think with the right
intuition and explanation, it's actually not too difficult, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
