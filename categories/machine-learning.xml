&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a blurb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the buzz around machine learning lately has been around novel
applications of deep learning models. They have captured our imagination by
anthropomorphizing them, allowing them to dream, play games at superhuman
levels, and read x-rays better than physicians. While these deep learning
models are incredibly powerful with incredible ingenuity built into them,
they are not humans, nor are they much more than “sufficiently large
parametric models trained with gradient descent on sufficiently many
examples.” In my experience, this is not the hard part about machine
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the flashy headlines, the high-level math, and the computation-heavy
calculations, the whole point of machine learning — as has been with
computing and software before it — has been its application to real-world
outcomes. Invariably, this means dealing with the realities of messy data,
generating robust predictions, and automating decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as much of the impact of machine learning is beneath the surface, the
hard parts of machine learning are not usually sexy. I would argue that the
hard parts about machine learning fall into two areas: generating robust
predictions and building machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a blurb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Rubikloud, a big focus of our data science team is empowering retailers
in delivering personalized one-to-one communications with their customers. A
big aspect of personalization is recommending products and services that are
tailored to a customer’s wants and needs. Naturally, recommendation systems are
an active research area in machine learning with practical large scale
deployments from companies such as Netflix and Spotify. In Part 1 of this
series, I’ll describe the unique challenges that we have faced in building a
retail specific product recommendation system and outline one of the main
components of our recommendation system: a collaborative filtering algorithm.
In Part 2, I’ll follow up with several useful applications of collaborative
filtering and end by highlighting some of its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Collaborative Filtering</category><category>Machine Learning</category><category>Recommendation Systems</category><category>Rubikloud</category><guid>http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/beyond-collaborative-filtering/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 22:00:34 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
