the most common one, the mean-field approximation.  This is a topic that I've
been trying to understand for a while now but didn't quite have all the background
that I needed.  After picking up the main ideas from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/the-calculus-of-variations/"&gt;variational calculus&lt;/a&gt; and
getting more fluent in manipulating probability statements like
in my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/the-expectation-maximization-algorithm/"&gt;EM&lt;/a&gt; post,
this variational Bayes stuff seems a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variational Bayesian methods are a set of techniques to approximate posterior
distributions in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"&gt;Bayesian Inference&lt;/a&gt;.
If this sounds a bit terse, keep reading!  I hope to provide some intuition
so that the big ideas are easy to understand (which they are), but of course we
can't do that well unless we have a healthy dose of mathematics.  For some of the
background concepts, I'll try to refer you to good sources (including my own),
which I find is the main blocker to understanding this subject (admittedly, the
math can sometimes be a bit cryptic too).  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
