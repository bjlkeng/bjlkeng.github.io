solutions.  In general academic solutions play in the realm of idealized problem
spaces, removing themselves from needing to care about the messiness of the real-world.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;
competitions are a (small) step in the right direction towards dealing with messiness,
usually providing a true blind test set (vs. overused benchmarks), and opening a
few degrees of freedom in terms the techniques that can be used, which
usually eschews novelty in favour of more robust methods.  To this end, I
thought it would be useful to take a look at a more realistic problem (via a
Kaggle competition) and understand the practical details that result in a
superior solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will cover the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05351"&gt;first place solution&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a class="reference internal" href="http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/a-look-at-the-first-place-solution-of-a-dermatology-classification-kaggle-competition/#id2"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] to the

In addition to using tried and true architectures (mostly EfficientNets), they
have some interesting tactics they use to formulate the problem, process the
data, and train/validate the model.  I'll cover background on the
ML techniques, competition and data, architectural details, problem formulation, and
implementation.  I've also run some experiments to better understand the
benefits of certain choices they made.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
