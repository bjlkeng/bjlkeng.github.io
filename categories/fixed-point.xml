to work on this blog.  After a lot of thinking about how to best fit it into my
schedule, I've decided to &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to write shorter posts.  Although I do get
a lot of satisfaction writing long posts, it's not practical because of the
time commitment.  Better to break it up into smaller parts to be able to
"ship" often rather than perfect each post.
This also allows me to experiment with smaller scoped topics, which hopefully
will keep more more motivated as well.  Speaking of which...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about answering a random thought I had the other day: what would
happen if I kept passing an LLM's output back to itself?  I ran a few
experiments of trying to get the LLM to iteratively summarize or rephrase a
piece of text and the results are...  pretty much what you would expect.  But
if you don't know what to expect, then read on and find out what happened!&lt;/p&gt;
